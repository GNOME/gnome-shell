2008-11-23  Daniel Macks  <dmacks@netspace.org>

	reviewed by: Thomas Thurman

	* configure.in: only accept --enable-compositor if we find we can
	  actually composite.  Closes #560990.

2008-11-23  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/display.c: remove apparently spurious warnings about
	operations on window "none"

2008-11-23  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/util.c: Set _POSIX_C_SOURCE to 200112L as it should always
	have been, in an attempt to close #561962.

	* configure.in: Set -ansi so people stop complaining about C99.

2008-11-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/prefs.c: fix stupid infinite loop when GConf is turned off.

2008-11-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/prefs.c: fix two places where there was a warning
	if GConf was turned off.

2008-11-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/all-keybindings.h: "backward", not "backwards" throughout.

2008-11-20  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

2008-11-20  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Merged screen and window keybinding tables so that
	we can use just one file for the both.  Also incidentally
	closes #528337.  Further efficiencies of scale to come.

	* src/include/prefs.h: replace META_PREF_*_KEYBINDINGS
	  with META_PREF_KEYBINDINGS
	* src/core/keybindings.c: replace *_bindings with key_bindings
	  and similar throughout; all window-based functions are now
	  guaranteed to receive a window so don't need to check for
	  themselves
	  (find_handler): moved so it can also be called from
			  rebuild_binding_table
        * src/core/display-private.h: replace *_bindings with key_bindings
        * src/core/prefs.c: update_*_binding becomes update_key_binding;
          (change_notify): tidy up references to "enormous if statement"
			   since it's almost entirely gone now
        * src/core/all-keybindings.h: new merged version of
			   screen-bindings.h and window-bindings.h.

2008-11-16  David Trowbridge  <trowbrds@gmail.com>
 
 	This change adds support for the new _NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS
 	property and client message.  This allows client applications to request
 	that a fullscreen window cover more than one monitor.
 
 	* src/include/boxes.h:
	* src/core/boxes.c: Add meta_rectangle_union
 
 	* src/core/window-private.h:
	* src/core/window.c:
 	(meta_window_new_with_attrs, meta_window_free, set_net_wm_state,
 	meta_window_update_fullscreen_monitors, meta_window_client_message): Add
 	MetaWindow property to store fullscreen monitors field, update
 	_NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS property on windows, and handle client
 	message.
 
 	* src/core/atomnames.h: Add _NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS atom.
 
 	* src/core/constraints.c (setup_constraint_info): If
 	_NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS is interesting, use the data stored in
 	MetaWindow::fullscreen_monitors to determine the fullscreen area instead
 	of the basic xinerama_info area.
 
2008-11-11  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Removed deprecated calls.  Closes #560445.

	* src/core/delete.c: remove deprecated g_strcasecmp.
	* src/include/main.h: no actual deprecated call, but
	  a mention of one which was out of date.

2008-11-11  Maxim Ermilov  <zaspire@rambler.ru>

2008-11-08  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: added dependency on Zenity

        * src/include/window-bindings.h: "space" needs to be
          lowercase

2008-10-23  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Support _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY (i.e. allow third-party apps to decide
        whether a window is on all workspaces).  Bug found by Ka-Hing
        Cheung.  Closes #557536.

        * src/core/window.c (set_net_wm_state): report it

2008-10-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * configure.in: bump to 2.25.3 (thought the release script
          had already done this)

2008-10-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Fixes to make distcheck work again.

2008-10-22  Matthew Martin  <mtt.martin@gmail.com>

        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_set_demands_attention): minimised
          windows are necessarily obscured.  Closes #528927.

2008-10-22  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Slight transformation of the x-macros used in keybindings
        to make them clearer: write handler names out in full
        because the old suffix system was confusing to people
        skim-reading, and switched the order of the last two
        parameters so more would generally fit on a screen.

        * src/core/keybindings.c, src/core/schema-bindings.c
          src/core/prefs.c: sympathy changes
        * src/core/window-bindings.h, src/core/screen-bindings.h:
          transformation as above

2008-10-21   Christian Persch  <chpe@gnome.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: fix build when schemas are not installed.
        Closes #557335.

       * src/core/screen-bindings.h: Fix off-by-one error.
       * src/core/window-bindings.h: Fix off-by-one error.
       Closes #557201.

2008-10-18  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        During a discussion with Rodney Dawes about making life easier
        for the translators, he pointed out that the short and long
        forms of almost all the keybindings say much the same thing
        in different words.  I believe this is an unconscionable burden
        to place on translators, and have therefore merged the short
        and long descriptions into the short description.  The long
        is now a general explanation of the format, plus possibly a
        notice about reversibility.  Closes #469361, and should solve
        the l10n issue previously mentioned.

        * src/core/keybindings.c: reflect changes in *-bindings.h
        * src/core/schema-bindings.c: reflect changes in *-bindings.h
        * src/core/prefs.c: reflect changes in *-bindings.h
        * src/core/window-bindings.h: Add flags field, always the same
          currently, so that it's the same as screen-bindings.h.
          Also, lose ONLY_BOUND_BY_DEFAULT, since we already had a
          rather more elegant way to perform the same effect.
          And merge the long and short descriptions.
        * src/core/screen-bindings.h (, item): Merge the long and
          short descriptions.

2008-10-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in: Call GNOME_DOC_INIT() so we can use the gnome-doc-utils 
	variables in our Makefile.am:
	* doc/Makefile.am:
	* doc/creating_themes/Makefile.am
	* doc/creating_themes/C/creating_metacity_themes.xml:
	Added this new DocBook document, converted from the HTML here
	http://blogs.gnome.org/metacity/2008/05/30/themes/
	This will be installed for yelp and can be translated and hosted on 
	library.gnome.org.

2008-10-15  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Since Patrick Niklaus's checkin of 2008-08-14 dealt with windows with
        no icons not using fallback icons, we don't need fallback icons.

        * src/ui/theme.h: remove fallback icons from struct.
        * src/core/iconcache.c (meta_read_icons): don't look for fallbacks.
        * src/*/ui.[ch] (meta_ui_get_fallback_icons): removed
        * src/ui/theme-parser.c (typedef, parse_toplevel_element): don't
          parse fallback specifications.

2008-10-13  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * po/POTFILES.in: add screen-bindings.h

2008-10-13  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * po/POTFILES.in: raw schemas is now .in.in
        * po/LINGUAS: add Latin

2008-10-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Make the bindings in src/core/*-bindings.h generate
        GConf schemas too.  Note that there's an i18n issue
        (documented in schema-bindings.c) which will be fixed
        next checkin.

        * src/core/schema-bindings.c: major fixup to make it
          ready for use as part of the actual build process.
        * src/Makefile.am: added magic to make it call schema-bindings
          after it builds it.
        * src/core/window-bindings.h: added comments;
          also, window menu was listed variously as alt-Space
          and alt-Print; it should have been alt-Space.
        * src/metacity.schemas.in.in: renamed from s/\.in$//,
          sentinel added for the generated bindings,
          warning at the top now untrue, and removed.

2008-10-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Fix annoying bug where alt-tab and friends would jump
        backwards a space on initial movement.

        * src/core/screen-bindings.h: although reversed bindings
        are necessarily reversible, don't set both bits in the
        constant, or when we test for them we'll get confused.

2008-10-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        An attempt to make life a little easier for our beloved translators;
        this has the same behaviour as before, but removes over thirty
        translation strings.

        * src/core/session.c (start_element_handler): all "attribute not found
          on element" strings are identical
        * src/ui/theme-parser.c (locate_attributes): allow attribute names to
          be preceded with "!" (in the code) to show they're required.
          (parse_aspect_ratio, parse_distance, parse_toplevel_element,
           parse_style_element, parse_gradient_element, static, parse_border,
           parse_style_set_element, parse_draw_op_element): use the new "!"
           prefix for locate_attributes(), or in some cases just the identical
           constant, for generating this error.
        * src/ui/theme.c (check_state, meta_theme_validate): add
          translator comments
        * src/ui/resizepopup.c (update_size_window): add
          translator comments

2008-10-06  William Lachance  <wrlach@gmail.com>

        Pass modified mouse button events down to panel windows
        instead of dealing with them ourselves.  Closes #554428.

        * src/core/display.c (prefs_changed_callback): don't grab mouse
          buttons on panels
        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): ditto

2008-10-05  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Second half of the switch to using x-macros for keybindings so that
        we don't have lots of places with the same information which must
        stay in the same order.  This time it's screen bindings.

        * src/core/screen-bindings.h: New file, containing screen bindings.
        * src/core/schema-bindings.c: added ability to output screen bindings.
        * src/core/window-bindings.h: tiny tweak to comment
        * src/core/keybindings.c: generate function prototypes using s-b.h;
          several handlers modified to use ints rather than ints cast into
          pointers, or renamed.
        * src/include/prefs.h: generate names of bindings using s-b.h;
          generate screen_handlers using s-b.h;
          arguments to bindings are ints and not ints cast to pointers;
          several handler functions renamed to consistent names.
        * src/core/prefs.c (meta_prefs_set_num_workspaces, init_bindings):
          generate screen_handlers using s-b.h;
          generate screen_string_bindings using s-b.h (and add check for
          null bindings in init_bindings to enable this simply).

2008-10-05  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * tools/ppa-magic.py: experimental tool for Launchpad upload

2008-10-05  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * metacity.doap: Havoc is an author; Thomas has an email address;
          add a ton of release information going back to the early days,
	  although not right to the beginning.

2008-09-26  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * autogen.sh: not all versions of /bin/sh can handle this script,
          so specify one.  Also update the error message because we don't
          use CVS these days.

2008-09-20  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * po/POTFILES.in: fix name of window-bindings.h

2008-09-20  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * po/POTFILES.in: added new files and re-sorted

2008-09-12  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

        Install desktop files in both
        .../share/applications and .../share/gnome/wm-properties.
        Copied in from the 2.23.x branch.  Closes #549479.

        * src/metacity-wm.desktop.in: new file
        * src/.cvsignore: include the above
        * src/Makefile.am: install the above

2008-09-06  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        An attempt to keep all information about window bindings
        in the same place.  Screen bindings to come.

        * src/core/window-bindings.h: new file, list of all window bindings
        * src/include/prefs.h: drop all the existing window-binding macros

        * src/core/schema-bindings.c (): output all the schema blocks that
        would appear in metacity.schema for these window bindings.  This
        ought to become part of the build process, and hopefully will soon.
        When this works it will also close #469361.

        * src/core/keybindings.c: generate handle_* prototypes using
        x-macros;  populate window_handlers using x-macros;  rename several
        functions to have consistent names;  do_handle_move_to_workspace(),
        handle_move_to_workspace_flip(), and handle_move_to_workspace() all
        merged into handle_move_to_workspace.

        * src/core/prefs.c: generate window_bindings and window_string_bindings
        using x-macros;  (meta_prefs_set_compositing_manager) fix unrelated
        problem with use of GConf functions when GConf was disabled.

        * src/core/core.c (meta_core_get_menu_accelerator): binding names
        given as literals since this is the only place in the code they
        now appear


2008-09-03  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/metacity.desktop.in: removed invalid "Window Manager" group
          at request of Matthias Clasen.

2008-09-02  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Desktop file moved, according to policy change.  Closes #549479.

        * src/metacity.desktop.in: Don't display the desktop file
        * src/Makefile.am: Desktop file goes in apps directory

2008-08-18  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Adding doxygen headers to some files.

        * src/core/workspace.c (ensure_work_areas_validated): add a copy of
         each strut in a window to the workspace's strut list, instead of
         using the copy in the list (which would mean it was double-freed).
         Believed to fix #468075.

2008-08-16  Ted Percival  <ted@midg3t.net>

        Ensure the user_rect is set sanely for windows that start maximized.
        Prevents maximized windows from warping across the screen.
        Fixes bug #504692.

        * src/core/window.c (save_user_placement): renamed version of
        meta_window_save_user_rect().
        * src/core/window.c (force_save_user_placement): similar, but will
        always save user_rect even if the window is maximised or fullscreen.
        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_move_resize_internal): unplaced
        windows have force_save_user_placement() called instead of
        save_user_placement().

2008-08-14   Patrick Niklaus  <marex@compiz-fusion.org>

          Icons for windows are taken from the desktop theme, not from
          the Metacity theme or from the fallback icon that Metacity
          provided.  Closes #524343.

        * src/ui/ui.c: Use GtkIconTheme to load the default window icon.
          Assumes the existence of an icon called "window", otherwise
          falls back to "gtk-missing-image". Fixes #524343.
        * src/ui/preview-widget: See above.
        * src/include/common.h: Add META_DEFAULT_ICON_NAME.
        * src/Makefile.am: Remove default_icon.png from inlinepixbufs.h.
        * src/default_icon.png: Removed.

2008-07-13  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c (event_callback): meta_display_screen_for_root()
        can return NULL, so check for that.  Fixes #422242.  Also tidying.

2008-07-13  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

        * src/core/workspace.c (meta_workspace_free): Don't attempt to
        double-free struts, edges and regions if work areas have already
        been invalidated at the time of freeing a workspace.
        Possible fix to #361804.

2008-07-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/group.c (meta_window_get_group): This function can now
        officially return NULL.
        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_same_application): Two windows can't
        belong to the same application unless they both belong to some
        application.  (Both belonging to no application is not the same.)

2008-06-30  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/bell.c (meta_bell_set_audible): Fix typo that

        * src/ui/theme-viewer.c (main): display the theme name
          in the title bar.  Closes #430198.

2008-06-29  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Allow toggling of non-compositor effects (since there's a
        non-Metacity key to do so: /desktop/gnome/interface/enable_animations).
        Closes #92867.

        * src/include/prefs.h: add META_PREFS_GNOME_ANIMATIONS key and
          meta_prefs_get_gnome_animations() function
        * src/include/prefs.c: added meta_prefs_get_gnome_animations()
          function, and made supporting changes to structs.
        * src/core/effects.c (run_handler): checked whether enable_animations
          is set before running an effect.
        * src/core/effects.c (meta_effect_run_minimize): remove debug message.

2008-06-29  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

          replace our own cast with glib macro designed to do the same thing

2008-06-28  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/xprops.c: fix type error which was causing warnings.

2008-06-28  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Some refactoring, simplifying, and commenting of the non-composited
        effects code.  effects.c could still do with some polish, which will
        come along later.

        * src/core/effects.h (meta_push_effect_handler): removed since it's
          never used and does nothing very useful.
        * src/core/effects.h (meta_pop_effect_handler): removed since its
          only effect is to crash the program.
        * src/core/effects.h (META_MINIMIZE_ANIMATION_LENGTH,
          META_SHADE_ANIMATION_LENGTH): move to effects.c because they're used
          nowhere else.
        * src/core/effects.c: there were three versions of the box-zoom effect.
          Remove the one which was never used, and make only the ones which
          are used with certain configure settings be compiled.
        * src/core/effects.h (meta_effect_end): move to effects.c, make static,
          and rename to effect_free.
        * src/core/effects.h (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): move to
          effects.c, make static, and rename to draw_box_animation.
        * src/core/effects.h (MetaEffectType): remove the values which weren't
          used.
        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_shade): remove commented-out code to
          call effect for shading.
        * src/core/effects.h (MetaEffectFinish): remove useless MetaEffect
          parameter.
        * src/core/window.c (finish_minimize): remove MetaEffect parameter.

2008-06-27  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/stack.h: Commented everything.

2008-06-26  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Keep the compiler from giving some warnings.
        
        * src/compositor/compositor-xrender.c (xrender_begin_move,
          xrender_update_move, xrender_end_move, xrender_free_window): four
          functions which were never called and contain no code #iffed out.
        * src/tools/metacity-mag.c (grab_area_at_mouse): fixed typecast error.

2008-06-26  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Refactor so the long scary stack functions are less long and scary:

        * stack.c (stack_ensure_sorted): the five parts of this long function
          broken out into the new functions stack_do_window_deletions,
          stack_do_window_additions, stack_do_relayer, stack_do_constrain
          (which was already separate: see next) and stack_do_resort.
        * stack.c (constrain_stacking): renamed to stack_do_constrain.
        * stack.c (stack_ignore_sorted): lose meta prefix since it's static.
        
2008-06-16  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * configure.in: Post-release bump to 2.23.55.

          Re-ordered fields in existing preferences so that changing to
          a union-based system will be easier in the future.

2008-06-10  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * test/tokentest/tokentest.c (draw_string_to_spec): doubles are
	  %f or %g, not %d
        * test/tokentest/tokentest.ini: re-created fair copy accordingly

2008-06-10  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * test/tokentest:  A preliminary attempt at a test for the
          theme expression tokeniser.

2008-06-05  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/compositor/compositor-xrender.c (paint_root, destroy_win,
        create_root_buffer, paint_windows, repair_screen, window_has_shadow,
        xrender_set_active_window, paint_dock_shadows, unmap_win, restack_win,
        make_shadow, resize_win, process_property_notify, free_win,
        process_configure_notify, process_circulate_notify, add_damage):
        defensive programming; check meta_screen_get_compositor_data()
        throughout in case it returns NULL.  In particular, when this
        happened in a certain situation in xrender_set_active_window
        this caused a segfault; refs #530702 (and LP#178953 has more data)
        but this doesn't close them.

2008-05-02  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        All information should live in exactly one place.  This means
        that the list of atoms should not be replicated anywhere.
        Therefore, we include it via x-macros.  Closes #530843.

        * src/core/atomnames.h: added list of atom names
        * src/Makefile.am: added reference to new file
        * src/core/display.h

        caused crashes in gnome-appearance-properties.  No GNOME
        bug number, but I believe this is a fix for Launchpad bug
        #199402 and its many duplicates.

2008-03-28  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): Don't
        immediately unminimize an initially iconic window (#491090)

2008-03-27  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/session.c (regenerate_save_file, save_state, load_state):
        files are saved in ~/.config/metacity/sessions and checked for there
        and in ~/.metacity/sessions.  Fixes #518596.

2008-03-27  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c (meta_display_close): fix regression
        where Metacity sometimes wouldn't quit when replaced

2008-03-26  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c (event_callback): meta_display_screen_for_root
        is quite capable of returning NULL.

2008-03-25  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c (meta_display_queue_retheme_all_windows,
        meta_set_syncing, meta_display_set_cursor_theme, disable_compositor,
        meta_display_for_x_display, meta_display_open, meta_display_close,
        meta_display_ungrab): MetaDisplay becomes a singleton.  The static
        variable which holds this singleton is renamed "the_display" so as
        not to mask the this parameter in the methods.

        * src/core/main.c (main):
        * src/core/session.c (warn_about_lame_clients_and_finish_inte,
        save_state, io_from_warning_dialog):
        * src/core/core.c (meta_core_increment_event_serial):
        * src/core/delete.c (release_window_with_fd, search_and_destroy_window):
        sympathy changes for this, and consequent simplification.
        Closes #499301.

	screen argument.

	(unmap_win): If the window is also focus window NULLify it.

	* src/core/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): Notify when a window
	has lost focus, pass in screen as well.

2008-03-18  Iain Holmes  <iain@gnome.org>

2008-03-11  Matthew Wilson  <msw@gimp.org>

        * src/core/keybindings.c (meta_display_process_key_event, process_event,

        * tools/release-wrangler.py: basic md5 printing (not used yet);
	also print release announcements to stdout (eventually will
	need to be emailed to release list and blogged)

2008-03-06  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	Part three of the great prefs refactor, this time
	dealing with string preferences.  (This was the most
	complicated part, and has been especially tested and
	valground before committing.  As ever, though, let us
	know if you find a problem.)

	* src/core/prefs.c (update_*): replaced with *_handler
	* src/core/prefs.c (meta_prefs_init): uses new string prefs
	  init; uses array of gconf dirs to monitor rather than
	  repeating code.

	* src/core/prefs.c (change_notify): uses new string prefs

2008-03-04  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * MAINTAINERS: added some spacing to see whether it
	helps Pulse

2008-03-03  Cosimo Cecchi  <anarki@lilik.it>

	Add ability to vertically and horizontally maximise
	using the mouse, by clicking the titlebar in various
	ways.  A very similar patch was received from Jason Ribero.

	both submitted patches which solved this differently.
	Closes #358674.

        * src/include/common.h (MetaActionTitlebar): new values
	for the new actions

	necessary)
        * src/core/prefs.c (symtab_titlebar_action): new string
	representations of the action values
        * src/metacity.schemas.in: documentation

2008-02-28  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	through the tests!)

2008-02-27  Jim Huang  <jserv.tw@gmail.com>

        * src/core/spring-model.[ch]: deleted as no longer used
        * src/Makefile.am: modified accordingly

2008-02-27  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	Lots of tiny fixes to make sure we compile with
	"gcc -ansi -Werror".

2008-02-26  Jens Granseuer  <jensgr@gmx.net>

        * src/core/constraints.c (constrain_aspect_ratio,
	constrain_size_limits, constrain_size_increments):
	reorder declarations so we don't break C89 compilers.
	Closes #518917.

        * NEWS: 2.23.0 release.

2008-02-26  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * tools/release-wrangler.py: ANY post-release bump is now the
	most recent, not just the one that matches the current version.
	Otherwise, you can't use these tools straight after a branch.
	The changeset before this one was mislabelled because of this.
	It has now been excised from the changelog.

2008-02-25  Thomas Wood  <thos@gnome.org>

        * src/ui/preview-widget.[ch] (meta_preview_get_clip_region):
	allow users of the preview widget to get a mask for windows

	use the new functions.
	* src/core/prefs.c (update_*): several of these removed whose
	only purpose was to receive boolean preferences.

	the flow of ideas more obvious.
	* src/core/prefs.c (maybe_give_disable_workarounds_warning): new
	function containing duplicated code from elsewhere.
	* src/core/prefs.c (init_button_layout): only compiled when

	* tools/commit-wrangler.py: Print URL of changeset on success.

2008-02-23  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        Refactored handling of enumerated preferences.

        * src/core/prefs.c (handle_preference_init_enum,
	handle_preference_update_enum): new functions.
        (meta_prefs_init, change_notify): use regularised
	forms and remove old copy-and-pasted code.
	Also many small similar functions removed which
	only existed to deal with each kind of enum.
	Also some amount of correction of which parts were
	and weren't inside "#ifdef HAVE_GCONF" blocks.


2008-02-21  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Ctrl-Alt-Tab list. Closes #106249.

2008-02-18  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	that means we did find it, not that we didn't.
	Closes #328210.

2008-02-18  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/window.c (warp_grab_pointer): When
	resizing a window with the keyboard, stay one 
	pixels from the edges so that the cursor remains
	resting on a window edge even if we escape,
	whatever side it was on. Closes #436257.

2008-02-17  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * tools/commit-wrangler.py: added new script to manage commits

2008-02-17  Jim Huang  <jserv.tw@gmail.com>

        * src/core/prefs.c (update_binding): Allow compilation
	when gconf mode is disabled. Closes #515019.

2008-02-14  Jim Huang  <jserv.tw@gmail.com>

	* src/core/display.c, src/core/util.c: fixups to allow

2008-02-04  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	we have a compositor. Closes #514453.

2008-02-04  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * configure.in, src/ui/ui.c: remove workaround for a problem
        in GTK 1.3.9(!) which was causing problems. Closes #513737.

2008-01-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/core/display.c (meta_display_open),
	* src/core/compositor.c: fetch & use composite
	version, for remote screens that don't match the
	compile system's version.
	(meta_compositor_manage_screen): bin erroneous FIXME.
	(add_win): remove common warning churn for (very)
	transient windows

2008-02-03  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * tools/patch-wrangler.py: another program I use for maintenance
	which other people might find useful and which should probably
	be in svn. Also not very polished.

2008-02-03  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * test/tokentest/tokentest.c, test/tokentest/tokentest.ini: added
	new files for a regression test on the tokeniser. (They aren't very

	more error checking.

2008-02-03  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * tools/release-wrangler.py: basic release script; needs work,
	but probably good enough for the current unstable release

2008-02-02  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: core.h is in include, not core. (Last one, I
	    promise.)

2008-02-02  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: main.h is in include, not core.

2008-02-02  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/Makefile.am: draw-workspace.h is in ui, not core.

2008-02-01  Alex R.M. Turner  <armtuk@gmail.com>

	* src/core/display.c (meta_get_tab_entry_list): Have the list also pull 
          windows that are in other workspaces that have the  
          wm_state_needs_attention flag set
        * src/core/window.c (meta_window_set_demands_attention): Make windows that
          are on other workspaces that demand attention that aren't obscured

	* src/ui/theme.[ch]: more commenting.

2008-01-18  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/ui/theme.[ch]: some more commenting.

	* src/core/bell.c: Correct comment.
	* src/core/main.c: Correct comment.
	* src/ui/theme.c: Much commenting; #ifdeffed-out
	debug code removed.
	* src/ui/theme.h: Much commenting.

2008-01-13  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/bell.c: Commenting.
	* src/core/main.c: Commenting, and fixing existing comments.
	
2008-01-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/main.c: Refactor repeated lines in main() to
	iterate instead.

	* src/core/main.[ch] (meta_get_main_loop): removed as it
	was never used.
	* src/core/main.c: lots of comments.
	* src/core/main.c (version): copyright year is 2008.
        * src/core/c-screen.[ch], src/core/c-window.[ch]: removed
	files from Søren's compositor which were removed by the
	merge with Iain's compositor but reintroduced by the split

2008-01-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

	* src/core/display.c: reinstated missing first character!
	* Doxyfile: correct reordering of blank fields.

2008-01-12  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c: change comments from /*! to /** because the
	other way makes doxygen think they are Qt comments, which messes
	up brief descriptions.
	* Doxyfile: check in so other people can generate documentation
	too.

2008-01-07  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c: further commenting (trying to keep comment
	    addings down to once a day at most so you don't all get spammed
	    too much).

2008-01-07  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/main.c (main): g_free is a no-op on nulls; there is no
	need to test.

2008-01-06  Thomas Thurman  <tthurman@gnome.org>

        * src/core/display.c: Function commenting marathon; more to come.

	(timeout_debug): Two really minor coding standards layout tweaks.

2007-12-27  Iain Holmes  <iain@gnome.org>

	* src/core/compositor.c: Don't do anything in 
	meta_compositor_free_window, it doesn't seem to be needed and breaks
	things very badly. http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504876

2007-12-27  Iain Holmes  <iain@gnome.org>

	* src/core/compositor.c: When a window is mapped, don't set damaged to
	TRUE. Fixes a bug when redrawing shadows.

2007-12-25  Iain Holmes  <iain@gnome.org>

	* src/core/compositor.c: USe the compositor overlay window instead of
	the root window. 
	
2007-12-21  Paolo Borelli  <pborelli@katamail.com>

	* src/core/core.c (meta_invalidate_default_icons): do not leak list.

	* src/core/edge-resistance.c 
	(meta_display_compute_resistance_and_snapping_edges): ditto.

	* src/core/workspace.c (meta_workspace_index): small cleanup in list
	handling.

	* src/ui/ui.c (meta_ui_get_fallback_icons): new function

2007-12-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/ui, src/core, src/include: sort source files into these
	directories according to which part of the WM they are supposed to
	be in. In an eventual plan, we should also create
	src/compositor/render, src/compositor/fallback and move some of
	the compositor stuff into that.
	
	* autogen.sh: require a newer automake, so we don't have to use
	a recursive build

	* src/ui/tabpopup.c: put in a hack to make the build temporarily
	work, want to commit the large rearrangement before fixing this
	not to include workspace.h or frame.h

	* src/core/iconcache.c (meta_read_icons): temporarily break this
	to get the build to work, want to commit the large rearrangement
	before fixing this file not to include theme.h

	code was highly buggy, though to be fair it was never tested and
	had simply been put into the code in commented out form.

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint):
	add atom_net_moveresize_window

	* src/window.[ch]:
	(meta_window_configure_request, meta_window_move_resize_request):
	Split out the moving/resize part of the configure request and put
	it into meta_window_move_resize_request

	(meta_window_client_message):
	check for NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW messages and call
	meta_window_move_resize_request() with the appropriate parameters
	to handle them

	(meta_window_move_resize_internal):
	fix some of the big comment at this function -- it wasn't quite
	right, use the passed in gravity instead of
	window->size_hints.win_gravity when calling adjust_for_gravity()
	to make sure the correct adjustments are used.

	(meta_window_get_gravity_position,
	 meta_window_get_geometry, meta_window_move_resize_request):
	add a gravity parameter to meta_window_get_gravity_position and
	have it use that gravity instead of window->size_hints.win_gravity

        * NEWS: 2.19.2 release.

2007-04-08  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Remove grab_start_serial, which we expect to be an ancient attempt
	to workaround sloppy/mouse focus bugs that have since been
	correctly fixed.  May fix some race conditions.  May cause nasty
	bugs in sloppy/mouse focus modes.  We'll find out soon enough...
	See #304430.

	* src/display.c (event_callback):
	remove event->xany.serial >= display->grab_start_serial in several
	event callback handlers

	don't require an event_serial to be passed to
	meta_display_begin_grab_op () and don't record it anymore.

	* src/ui.c (struct _EventFunc, filter_func,
	  meta_ui_get_last_event_serial)
	* src/core.h (meta_ui_get_last_event_serial):
	remove meta_ui_get_last_event_serial() function (don't ask me why
	it was declared in core.h) and the last_even_serial field of
	_EventFunc
	
2007-04-08  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Fix move/resize events in relation to combinations of
	ConfigureRequest and WM_NORMAL_HINTS change notifications (plus a
	few code cleanups).  Fixes #426519.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_move_resize_now):
	move to the user_rect position, not some weird combination of rect
	and user_rect

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request):
        set user_rect in response to ConfigureRequest events (after the
	ConfigureRequest values have been constrained) and add a big
	comment explaining this change, remove unused only_resize variable
	and irrelevant huge FIXME comment about it

	* src/window.[ch] (meta_window_get_client_root_coords):
	new function

	* src/display.c (meta_display_begin_grab_op):
	* src/keybindings.c (process_keyboard_move_grab):

	  warp_grab_pointer)
	combine multi-step client rect root coord setting into a single
	function call to meta_window_get_client_root_coords()

2007-04-08  Thomas Thurman  <thomas@thurman.org.uk>

2007-04-07  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/prefs.[ch] (screen_bindings array,
	  META_KEYBINDING_SET_SPEW_MARK definition):
	* src/keybindings.c (handle_spew_mark, screen_handlers array):
	Add an (unbound by default) keybinding for setting spew marks in
	verbose debugging logs.  I'm not sure why this was ever removed;
	I've wanted it so many times.

	* HACKING:
	valgrind wants --log-file not --logfile.

2007-04-07  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): Fix memory bug (invalid free)
	introduced in 2007-04-02 strut cleanup commit.  Part of #427385.

2007-04-05  Thomas Thurman  <thomas@thurman.org.uk>

	* src/theme_parser.c: if theme is invalid and therefore got
	freed, don't attempt to read from it. Closes #423855.

        * NEWS: 2.19.1 release.

2007-04-04  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_move_resize_internal): send synthetic
	configurenotify events also in response to MapRequest events when
	the window has a frame and the application specifies PPosition or
	UPosition hints.  I believe they are already sent for all other
	cases.  Should fix #322840.  Fixes the testcase at least.  :)

2007-04-04  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Fix lots of little issues with min/max constraints and size
	increment constraints.  Fixes #329152, #418395, and possibly
	others.

	* src/window-props.c (meta_set_normal_hints):
	Do more checking to make sure application specified constraints
	are self-consistent, modifying the size_hints as necessary to
	achieve self-consistency.

	* src/constraints.c (setup_constraint_info): remove ugly
	copy-pasto, (constrain_size_increments): be careful that fixing
	violation of the constraints doesn't cause a violation of the
	minimum size constraints.

	* src/window.c (ensure_size_hints_satisfied): new function,
	(meta_window_unmaximize, meta_window_unmake_fullscreen): the
	saved_rect may no longer be valid (as in the case of #329152) so
	call ensure_size_hints_satisfied to fix it up.

	* doc/how-to-get-focus-right.txt: Some minor spacing and wording
	fixes completely unrelated to the rest of this commit

2007-04-03  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_unmaximize):
	Only use saved_rect for determining the position to unmaximize to
	for the previously-maximized direction(s).  Fixes #355497.

2007-04-03  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

2007-04-03  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/keybindings.c (handle_panel_keybinding): turn mouse_mode off
	to prevent focus issues with the run application dialog.  Fixes
	#374752.

2007-04-03  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Avoid some crashes when dragging windows partially offscreen.
	Possible (or at least partial) fix for #353513.

	* src/edge-resistance.c (apply_edge_resistance): be more careful
	about calls to find_index_of_edge_near_position() returning
	possibly invalid indices.  Also, add a warning comment to
	find_index_of_edge_near_position().

2007-04-03  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Patch from Carlo Wood to do some miscellaneous code cleanups found
	while working on #358311.

	* src/constraints.c (do_screen_and_xinerama_relative_constraints):
	nicer way of avoiding compilation warning

	* src/boxes.c (meta_rectangle_clamp_to_fit_into_region,
	  meta_rectangle_clip_to_region, meta_rectangle_shove_into_region):
	Much cleaner way of ignoring invalid boxes in comparisons

2007-04-02  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Patch from Carlo Wood to fix handling of unidirectional
	maximization and partial struts.  #358311.

	* src/constraints.c (constrain_maximization):
	determine target size for unidirectionally maximized windows by
	determining how far they can be maximized without hitting
	orthogonal struts.  Avoids weird "empty spaces".

	* src/boxes.[ch] (meta_rectangle_expand_to_avoiding_struts):
	new function

2007-04-02  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Make the strut lists (stored in workspaces) record both the
	rectangle and the side that the strut is on.  Lots of code
	cleanups relating to struts.

	* src/boxes.h (struct MetaStrut):
	new struct for struts

	* src/window.[ch] (struct MetaStruts, struct MetaWindow,
	  meta_window_update_struts):
	overhaul to make window's struts remember their side as well as
	their rectangular location, and just use a list instead of several
	copies of near-identical code for left/right/top/bottom (allowing
	us to nuke MetaStruts struct as well)
	
	* src/testboxes.c (new_meta_strut, get_strut_list):
	* src/workspace.c (ensure_work_areas_validated):
	* src/boxes.c (meta_rectangle_get_minimal_spanning_set_for_region,

	  get_disjoint_strut_rect_list_in_region, fix_up_edges,
	  meta_rectangle_find_onscreen_edges,
	  meta_rectangle_find_nonintersected_xinerama_edges):
	modify to handle struts being rectangle + side instead of just rectangle

	* src/workspace.c (ensure_work_areas_validated):
	simplify strut list creation considerably given MetaWindow change,
	modify work_area computations to take advantage of region
	computations being done (makes the code shorter as well as more
	robust against pathological cases).

	* src/util.[ch] (meta_free_gslist_and_elements):
	new convenience function

	* src/common.h (enum MetaDirection):
	* src/edge-resistance.c (movement_towards_edge):

	Add more MetaDirection fields for convenience

	* src/boxes.h (enum FixedDirections):
	* src/constraints.c (setup_constraint_info, place_window_if_needed):
	add a FIXED_DIRECTION_NONE to the FixedDirections enum to make
	code more clear

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open):
	make it explicit that we can't rely on PropertyNotify events for
	the leader_window due to nasty metacity/gdk interaction

	* src/session.c (warn_about_lame_clients_and_finish_interact):
	remove cut-and-paste code for timestamp pinging and just call
	meta_display_get_current_time_roundtrip

2007-03-30  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Add support for _NET_WM_USER_TIME_WINDOW in order to cut down on

	new hooks to handle new atom

2007-03-25  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* configure.in: bump version to 2.19.1; doesn't make sense to have

	window manager can restore it

2006-10-01  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/window-props.c (set_title_text): surround the
	XDeleteProperty() call with a

	#358514.

2006-10-01  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Fix longstanding focus bug with mouse (not sloppy) focus mode with

	* src/constraints.c (setup_constraint_info): if a window tries to
	resize to fullscreen-size and it has a fullscreen function but
	isn't actually marked as fullscreen then assist it by marking it
	as such, (constrain_fully_onscreen, constrain_titlebar_visible):
	ignore this constraint for fullscreen windows since such windows
	have a separate specialized constraint

	* src/stack.c (window_is_fullscreen_size, get_standalone_layer):
	remove the old window_is_fullscreen_size() hack for detecting
	windows to treat as fullscreen since it doesn't work well with the
	new constraints framework (i.e. we needed a slightly different
	hack)

	* src/window.[ch] (meta_window_new_with_addrs): shuffle the order
	of adding the window to the stack and moveresizing the window
	since moveresizing can cause stack changes if the window's initial
	size is fullscreen size, (meta_window_make_fullscreen,
	meta_window_make_fullscreen_internal): split
	meta_window_make_fullscreen() similar to meta_window_maximize() so
	that constraints can make use of it

	in #123372, in order to fix accessibility.  #350624

2006-08-09  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/window.c (intervening_user_event_occurred): Vytautus Liuolia
	totally rocks; he tested and debugged and tracked down where we
	were using the focus window's net_wm_user_time even when it was
	uninitialized.  This may fix bug 311868 and others I've heard
	about (with Valknut, IIRC).  It definitely fixes the issues Vytas
	was seeing with his single instance library.  :-)

2006-08-07  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Add a constrain_titlebar_visible constraint; should fix both bug

	one), but tarballs are due in less than half an hour.  ;-)

	* src/boxes.[ch] (meta_rectangle_overlaps_with_region):
	new function

2006-08-07  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Patch from Vytautas Liuolia to react to _NET_STARTUP_ID changes,
	as proposed for the new startup-notification/EWMH spec.  #347515

	* src/window-props.c (reload_net_startup_id): be sure to act on
	the new id instead of just recording it

	* src/window.[ch] (window_activate, meta_window_activate,
	  meta_window_activate_with_workspace, meta_window_client_message):
	change window_activate() to take a workspace parameter instead of
	hardcoding to the current workspace, add
	meta_window_activate_with_workspace() function needed by
	reload_net_startup_id().

2006-08-07  Thomas Thurman  <thomas@thurman.org.uk>

	* src/frames.h: add new MetaButtonSpace struct; use it for

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): ignore window decoration
	when checking size for determing whether an unresizable window
	should be allowed ot be considered for fullscreening

	meta_display_set_input_focus_window,
	meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window): Track the active_screen,
	(event_callback): If the mouse enters a window on a different
	screen, activate the default window on the new screen.  May need
	to be modified for click-to-focus; we'll wait for feedback.  Fixes
	#319348.

2006-01-23  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_check_threshold_reached): change the

	problems

2006-01-21  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Patch from Christian Kirbach to prevent a critical warning crasher
	when switching themes.  #327847.

	* src/theme.c (meta_theme_free): since themes are only constructed

2006-01-20  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* src/constraints.c (setup_constraint_info): fixed_directions is
	only meant for explicit user interactions; disable it for
	everything else.  There are other bugs and improvements that could
	be made with fixed_directions that I should be filing too, but at
	least put a FIXME there for now--I'm so lame.  Fixes #327822.

2006-01-20  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	Avoid flashing when closing a maximized window.  Fixes #317254.

	Patch from Søren to fix some reading-from-free'd-data errors.
	#327575

	* src/edge-resistance.c (meta_display_cleanup_edges): store the

	value, (meta_prefs_init): get the titlebar_font and current_theme
	handled better when not using gconf, (struct MetaSimpleKeyMapping,
	screen_string_bindings, window_string_bindings): helper vars to
	allow some keybindings to work even without gconf,
	(init_bindings): initialize bindings for the without-gconf case
	too, (init_commands): make sure these are all NULL for the
	non-gconf case so that we don't access random memory,
	(init_workspace_names): just give these all a default name for the
	non-gconf case,
	(meta_prefs_change_workspace_name): actually change the name for
	the non-gconf case too
	
2006-01-20  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	More careful error handling of values returned by GConf.  Fixes
	#326615.

	use get_bool to handle the case of a gconf key not existing,
	(update_cursor_size): sanity check for sane values

	Prevent rapidly repeated visual bells from hanging metacity.
	Fixes #322032.

	no need to do the MRU shuffling if not maintaining the stacking
	order == MRU order invariant

	Don't "steal" focus from terminal windows for new window mappings
	as the difference in usage between terminals and other apps seems
	to suggest this difference in treatment.  See #326159 for details,
	feedback welcome.

	* src/window.[ch] (__window_is_terminal): New function, currently
	an ugly hack and should be replaced by a new property set by
	applications if the behavior works to our liking,

	terminals unless the new window is a transient of the focused
	terminal

	* src/keybindigns.c (handle_panel_keybinding): panel run dialog
	keybinding should be counted as an explicit transfer of focus to
	the new window, so override the

	More thorough handling of source indication.  Part of #326041.

	indication handling

	Make the taskbar less flash happy and fix up some related stacking
	issues.  #326035.

	* src/window.c (windows_overlap): new function,
	(meta_window_show): if a window is denied focus but doesn't
	overlap with the focus window there is no need to set the demands
	attention hint nor stack that window below the focus window,
	(meta_window_get_outer_rect): we're not modifying the window so
	declare it to be const

2006-01-09  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	Fix window outline for minimized windows when using alt-esc.
	#325092.

	* src/display.h (enum MetaTabShowType): new convenience enum

	* src/screen.[ch] (meta_screen_ensure_tab_popup): require the
	showing type be specified in addition to the tabbing type; put the
	outline around the window instead of the icon when in alt-esc

	* src/boxes.[ch]:
	(meta_rectangle_expand_region_conditionally):
	new function behaving like meta_rectangle_expand_region() but

	Remove a compiling warning

	* src/constraints.c:
	(constrain_partially_onscreen):
	provide minimum thresholds in each direction for the size of the

	* src/bell.c (meta_bell_notify_frame_destroy): Use the right

	Allow edge resistance at both sides of a window and also when

	* src/boxes.[ch]:
	(meta_rectangle_edges_align):
	new function to handle the overlap or off by one determining
	whether edge resistance should kick in for an edge.

	(meta_rectangle_edge_cmp_ignore_type):
	new function to sort edges but ignore the type so that e.g. left &
	right edges of windows can be used interchangeably.

	now uses meta_rectangle_edge_cmp_ignore_type() to do most the work
	and just adds an extra condition

	* src/edge-resistance.c:
	(find_nearest_position):
	use meta_rectangle_edges_align() now to determine whether the
	edges align,

	(apply_edge_resistance, apply_edge_resistance_to_each_side):
	have the edge resistance kick in if either the beginning or ending
	positions would cause overlap in the given direction -- fixes an
	uncommon but annoying corner case,

	 meta_display_cleanup_edges,
	 stupid_sort_requiring_extra_pointer_dereference, cache_edges):

	* NEWS:	2.13.3 release

2005-11-22  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	Don't allow removing a window from maximized or fullscreened state
	to place the titlebar under the top panel.  Fixes #322075.

	* src/display.c (handle_net_moveresize_window): fix up previous
	comments now that I know a little more, modify the code just
	slightly to clarify that this is NOT a manual user move/resize
	operation

	* src/window.c (meta_window_unmaximize,
	  meta_window_unmake_fullscreen,
	  meta_window_shove_titlebar_onscreen):
	don't claim that these are manual user move/resize operations

2005-11-21  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* src/constraints.c (constrain_partially_onscreen): Relax the
	partially onscreen constraint to allow the titlebar to touch the
	bottom panel in order to make the new constraints code function
	the same as the old version.  Fixes #322071.
	
2005-11-21  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* src/constraints.c (place_window_if_needed): When updating the

2005-11-21  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* doc/strut-and-related-updating.txt: It took me a little while to
	figure out how struts & workareas are updated and to learn what
	all the related functions were used for so I thought I'd clean up
	my notes and make them available.  This will probably be more
	useful now since regions and edges are also computed and stored at
	the same time as the workareas.

	Merge of all the changes on the constraints_experiments branch.
	This is just a summary, to get the full ChangeLog of those
	changes (approx. 2000 lines):
	  cvs -q -z3 update -Pd -r constraints_experiments
	  cvs -q -z3 diff -pu -r CONSTRAINTS_EXPERIMENTS_BRANCHPOINT ChangeLog

	Bugs fixed:
	  unfiled - constraints.c is overly complicated[1]
	  unfiled - constraints.c is not robust when all constraints
	            cannot simultaneously be met (constraints need to be
	            prioritized)
	  unfiled - keep-titlebar-onscreen constraint is decoration
	            unaware (since get_outermost_onscreen_positions()
	            forgets to include decorations)
	  unfiled - keyboard snap-moving and snap-resizing snap to hidden
	            edges
	    86644 - resize should have a shift option like move does
	   109553 - gravity w/ simultaneous move & resize doesn't work
	   113601 - maximize vertical and horizontal should toggle and be
	            constrained
	   122196 - windows show up under vertical panels
	   122670 - jerky/random resizing of window via keyboard[2]
	   124582 - keyboard and mouse snap-resizing and snap-moving
	            erroneously moves the window multidimensionally
	   136307 - don't allow apps to resize themselves off the screen
	            (*cough* filechooser *cough*)
	   142016, 143784 - windows should not span multiple xineramas
	            unless placed there by the user
	   143145 - clamp new windows to screensize and force them
	            onscreen, if they'll fit
	   144126 - Handle pathological strut lists sanely[3]
	   149867 - fixed aspect ratio windows are difficult to resize[4]
	   152898 - make screen edges consistent; allow easy slamming of
	            windows into the left, right, and bottom edges of the
	            screen too.
	   154706 - bouncing weirdness at screen edge with keyboard moving
	            or resizing
	   156699 - avoid struts when placing windows, if possible (nasty
	            a11y blocker)
	   302456 - dragging offscreen too restrictive
	   304857 - wireframe moving off the top of the screen is misleading
	   308521 - make uni-directional resizing easier with
	            alt-middle-drag and prevent the occasional super
	            annoying resize-the-wrong-side(s) behavior
	   312007 - snap-resize moves windows with a minimum size
	            constraint
	   312104 - resizing the top of a window can cause the bottom to
	            grow
	   319351 - don't instantly snap on mouse-move-snapping, remove
	            braindeadedness of having order of releasing shift and
	            releasing button press matter so much

	   [1] fixed in my opinion, anyway.
	   [2] Actually, it's not totally fixed--it's just annoying
	       instead of almost completely unusable.  Matthias had a
	       suggestion that may fix the remainder of the problems (see
	       http://tinyurl.com/bwzuu).
	   [3] This bug was originally about not-quite-so-pathological
	       cases but was left open for the worse cases. The code from
	       the branch handles the remainder of the cases mentioned in
	       this bug.
	   [4] Actually, although it's far better there's still some minor
	       issues left: a slight drift that's only noticeable after
	       lots of resizing, and potential problems with partially
	       onscreen constraints due to not clearing any
	       fixed_directions flags (aspect ratio windows get resized in
	       both directions and thus aren't fixed in one of them)
	
	New feature:
	    81704 - edge resistance for user move and resize operations;
	            in particular 3 different kinds of resistance are
	            implemented:
             	 Pixel-Distance: window movement is resisted when it
	     	   aligns with an edge unless the movement is greater than
	     	   a threshold number of pixels
             	 Timeout: window movement past an edge is prevented until
	     	   a certain amount of time has elapsed during the
	     	   operation since the first request to move it past that
	     	   edge
             	 Keyboard-Buildup: when moving or resizing with the
	     	   keyboard, once a window is aligned with a certain edge
	     	   it cannot move past until the correct direction has
	     	   been pressed enough times (e.g. 2 or 3 times)

	Major changes:
	  - constraints.c has been rewritten; very few lines of code from
	    the old version remain.  There is a comment near the top of
	    the function explaining the basics of how the new framework
	    works.  A more detailed explanation can be found in
	    doc/how-constraints-works.txt
	  - edge-resistance.[ch] are new files implementing edge-resistance.
	  - boxes.[ch] are new files containing low-level error-prone
	    functions used heavily in constraints.c and edge-resistance.c,
	    among various places throughout the code.  testboxes.c
	    contains a thorough testsuite for the boxes.[ch] functions
	    compiled into a program, testboxes.
	  - meta_window_move_resize_internal() *must* be told the gravity
	    of the associated operation (if it's just a move operation,
	    the gravity will be ignored, but for resize and move+resize
	    the correct value is needed)
	  - the craziness of different values that
	    meta_window_move_resize_internal() accepts has been documented
	    in a large comment at the beginning of the function.  It may
	    be possible to clean this up some, but until then things will
	    remain as they were before--caller beware.
	  - screen and xinerama usable areas (i.e. places not covered by
	    e.g. panels) are cached in the workspace now, as are the
	    screen and xinerama edges.  These get updated with the
	    workarea in src/workspace.c:ensure_work_areas_validated()

	actually show minimized windows too.  Fixes #107072.

	* src/keybindings.c (process_tab_grab): initialize tab_unminimized
	to FALSE for the target window when starting the grab, when

	Get the tabbing window outline to work with gtk+ 2.8.4 again.
	Fixes #317528.

	* src/tabpopup.c (display_entry): gtk+ 2.8.4 needs to know the

	manually map with gdk_window_show_unraised() we need to manually
	set the mapped state too

	Improve the behavior of keyboard move/resize and edge
	snapping.  Still not perfect, bug 310888.

	* src/effects.c (draw_xor_rect): Make the outside of a
	wireframe rectangle line up with the outside edge of its
	window, instead of centering the wireframe edges on the
	window edges.

	* src/keybindings.c (process_keyboard_move_grab): allow
	edge snapping in wireframe mode.  Adjust code to take
	into account changed semantics of find_next_*_edge
	functions.
	(process_keyboard_resize_grab_op_change): new function 
	to take some orthogonal logic out of
	process_keyboard_resize_grab_op.  Only allow keyboard
	resize cursor to go to flat edges, not corners.
	(process_keyboard_resize_grab):  allow edge snapping in
	wireframe mode.  Fix up snapping logic.

	* src/place.c (get_{vertical,horizontal}_edges): use 
	GArray instead of int *, since the number of output
	edges isn't known until the middle of the function now.
	Use xor rect extents instead of window extends if in
	wireframe mode.
	(meta_window_find_next_{vertical,horizontal}_edge: add
	new source_edge_position parameter to specify which edge
	on the active window to start from when looking for next
	edge on the screen. Return the coordinate of the edge 
	found and not the coordinate of where the window should be
	moved to snap to where the edge was found.

	* src/window.c (update_move): all the user to specify
	an edge to resize with mouse in keyboard resize mode.

	* src/stack.c (is_focused_foreach, get_standalone_layer): use only
	the expected_focus_window instead of both the focused_window and
	the expected_focus_window.  Removes an infinite flicker loop in

	focus.  Fixes #311400.

	Bug 305564 again.

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_activate): when receiving a

	Big patch to cover about 6 different issues in order to correct
	rare problems with timestamps (make sure window selected in
	tasklist actually gets focus, sanity check timestamps to avoid
	rogue apps hosing the system, correct the updating of
	net_wm_user_time, correctly handle timestamps of 0 when comparing
	xserver timestamps for those who have had their systems up for
	over 25 days or so, add some debugging information to verbose
	logs, some code cleanups).  Fixes all issues listed in #167358.

	last_focus_time, introduce a new variable--last_user_time,
	(XSERVER_TIME_IS_BEFORE macro): put this functionality into a

	last_user_time should be used in this function
	
	* src/display.c (santiy_check_timestamps): new function,

	(meta_display_get_current_time_roundtrip): use the timestamp,
	which is known to be good, in order to sanity_check_timestamps,
	(event_callback): use the new meta_window_ste_user_time() function
	in order to correct problems, use the timestamp of KeyPress and
	ButtonPress events, which are known to be good, in order to
	sanity_check_timestamps, (timestamp_too_old): new function for
	common behavior of meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window and

	display->last_user_time in addition to display->last_focus_time,

	net_wm_user_time of any window

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_activate): add debugging spew, make
	sure the comparison is made with last_user_time NOT
	last_focus_time, use meta_window_set_user_time() function in order

	to a debugging message to make them easier to read,
	(meta_window_set_user_time): new function

	Raise the ancestor of a window instead of the window itself.
	Fixes #166894.

2005-02-12  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	Don't unconditionally place splashscreens (and other
	not-to-be-focused windows) below the focus window.  Fixes #167042.

	* src/window.c: (intervening_user_event_occurred): new function
	taken from the timestamp comparison portion of the old
	window_takes_focus_on_map function, (window_state_on_map): new
	function with remainder of old window_takes_focus_on_map function
	that determines both whether the window will take focus and
	whether it should be placed on top, (meta_window_show): use
	place_on_top_on_map to determine window stacking instead of trying
	to infer it from takes_focus_on_map

2005-02-11  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	possibly lost).  Fixes #166524.

	* src/place.c: new MetaWindowDirection enum,
	(find_most_freespace): new function to find where there is the
	most space available around the focused window,
	(meta_window_place): if a window is denied focus and the window

	paying attention to the focus window position and if that fails
	just find the location on the screen with the most space
	available.

	* src/window.h: (struct MetaWindow): new
	denied_focus_and_not_transient bitfield

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_new_with_attrs): initialize

	Removed useless function call.  #166730

	* src/tabpopup.c: (outline_window_expose): Removed unused
	references to variables and an unnecessary function call to
	gdk_window_get_size().

2005-02-08  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	Avoid using CurrentTime when focusing, handle it better in case we
	miss any cases.  Fixes #166732.

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_shade): use
	meta_display_get_current_time_roundtrip() to ensure we have a
	valid timestamp, (meta_window_unshade): same

	* src/display.c: (meta_display_set_input_focus_window): If
	CurrentTime was passed, get one from the XServer in addition to
	throwing a warning, (meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window): same

2005-02-08  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_activate): If we're not passed a

	safe to do so.  Again, thanks to Crispin Flowerday for the test
	case.  Thanks to KWin for the inspiration (and to Google for
	indexing their source code).  Fixes the other half of #166395.

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_configure_request): if the
	active_window is from a separate application than the one getting
	the configure request and the net_wm_user_time of the active
	window is later than that of the window getting the configure
	request, then ignore the request.

2005-02-06  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	If activation requests are too old, set the demands_attention hint
	instead of actually activating.  Thanks to Crispin Flowerday for

	Owen Taylor for providing test cases.  Fixes #145131.

	* src/window.c: (update_mwm_hints): Be sure to call
	recalc_window_features even if no MWM hints are set

	* doc/how-to-get-focus-right.txt: Note the distinction between
	"most recently used window" and "most recent to have keyboard
	focus" that we are now making.

	* src/workspace.c: (focus_ancestor_or_mru_window): rename from
	meta_workspace_focus_mru_window, and first check whether we need
	to focus an ancestor window before looking for the mru window,

	focus_ancestor_or_mru_window,

	Try 2 to correct misleading and inaccurate wording.  Hopefully,
	really fixes #165380.

	* src/menu.c: Change wording of menu from "Always on Current
	Workspace" to "Always on Visible Workspace".  "Always on Current
	Workspace" could sound like a synonym of "Only on This Workspace"
	when it was supposed to be the opposite.

2005-01-31  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	Correct the stacking when return from fullscreen mode.  Fixes

	Don't lower newly mapped windows when they're denied focus, if

	that EnterNotify events won't accidentally focus the new window.

2004-10-25  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/screen.c (queue_windows_showing): Revert the

	window_should_be_showing): split the old window_should_be_showing
	into these two functions, (set_net_wm_state): hidden state is more

	determine whether to end the grab
	
2004-10-19  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

	* src/frame.c: (meta_window_ensure_frame):
	Don't try to use an ARGB visual at all if the depth isn't
	32-bit. This caused major slowdowns with Composite enabled.
	
2004-10-16  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Code cleanup

	* src/window.c (is_in_dock_group, docks_at_end_cmp,
	shuffle_docks_to_end): removed functions,
	(meta_window_notify_focus): no need to call is_in_dock_group or

	committed.

2004-10-13  Vincent Untz  <vincent@vuntz.net>

	Add a keybinding to launch a terminal

	* src/keybindings.c: (handle_run_terminal): new function,

2004-10-11  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* NEWS, README: Metacity 2.8.6 (stable release)

2004-10-08  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix middle-frame-click-to-lower focus inconsistency (#154601)

	* src/core.c (meta_core_user_lower_and_unfocus): focus the default
	window in all focus modes, not just click-to-focus (EnterNotify
	events will not handle this case for sloppy and mouse focus)

	* src/display.c (event_callback): replace window->has_focus with
	window == display->expected_focus_window to avoid a race issue

2004-10-08  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

        Alter the meaning of expected_focus_window; doesn't affect
	current operation but assists in fixing some other bugs
	(#154598)
	
	* src/display.c (meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window): set the
	expected_focus_window to NULL.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): don't NULL the
	expected_focus_window when that window receives a FocusIn event

2004-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): if the root window gets focused,
	set the focus to the default window; this fixes the
	"focus-follows-mouse" behavior seen for click-to-focus mode after
	cancelling log out (fixes #153220)

2004-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix a variety of issues with autoraise (#134206)

	* src/display.h: (struct _MetaDisplay): add an autoraise_window
	parameter

	* src/display.[hc] (meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window): new
	function, (meta_display_queue_autoraise_callback): new function,

	display->autoraise_window too, (meta_display_close): remove any
	pending autoraise callback, (window_raise_with_delay_callback):
	clear out auto_raise->display->autoraise_window too,

	instead of having the code inline, call
	meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window to handle focusing that
	window

	* src/window.c (meta_window_focus): If there's a window with an
	autoraise timeout that isn't the window being focused, remove the
	autoraise timeout

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_focus_default_window): If no
	autoraise timeout is queued for the given window then queue one
	now, call meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window to handle
	focusing that window, (meta_workspace_focus_mru_window): call
	meta_display_focus_the_no_focus_window to handle focusing that
	window

2004-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): When no window becomes focused,
	focus the default window instead of punting to the
	no_focus_window.  Also, change the warning to a verbose
	message--this will happen frequently due to brain-damage in the X
	protocol.  (see #125492)

2004-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix a variety of focus race conditions in all focus modes, or at
	least make them harder to trigger (fixes #152000)

	* src/core.[ch] (meta_core_user_lower_and_unfocus): add a
	timestamp parameter; pass it along to
	meta_workspace_focus_default_window

	(meta_window_client_message), pass a timestamp to
	meta_workspace_focus_default_window

	parameter, (meta_workspace_activate_with_focus): add timestamp
	parameter, (meta_workspace_focus_default_window): add timestamp

	pass the timestamp on to meta_window_focus or
	meta_workspace_focus_mru_window or XSetInputFocus

2004-09-22  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/keybindings.c (process_workspace_switch_grab): Focus the
	default window after the user dismisses the workspace switcher
	popup (fixes #123803; note that an alternate fix was made
	independently by David Baron for sloppy and mouse focus users)

2004-09-22  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix some uninitialized variable errors reported by valgrind (see
	#153338)

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): Remove some redundant code
	regarding focusing the default window (#152117)

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Patch from Ken Harris in #135786 to focus a new default window
	when lowering via middle-click on the frame.

	* src/core.[hc], src/frames.c: rename meta_core_user_lower to
	meta_core_user_lower_and_unfocus

	* src/core.c (meta_core_user_lower_and_unfocus): if in
	click-to-focus mode then also move the window to the back of the
	mru list and focus the new default window for the active workspace

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Focus the no_focus_window if no suitable window is in the mru list
	(should fix the almost contrived extra issue found in #147475)

	* doc/how-to-get-focus-right.txt: We no longer need to lie about
	only focusing panels upon explicit request.

	* src/workspace.c: (meta_workspace_focus_top_window): removed this
	function--it was more code than needed and was unreliable anyway,
	(meta_workspace_focus_mru_window): if a suitable window isn't in
	the mru list, focus the no_focus_window instead of calling
	focus_top_window.

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Prevent focus inconsistencies by only providing one focus method
	(fixes #151990)

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_show_desktop): remove call to
	meta_workspace_focus_top_window (it was merely focusing a window
	that was going to be hidden anyway, and likely the one that
	already had focus)

	* src/workspace.[hc]: remove meta_workspace_focus_mru_window and
	meta_workspace_focus_top_window from workspace.h, make them static
	functions in workspace.c
	
2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Remove race condition for focus window choice on window close
	followed by rapid mouse movement in sloppy and mouse focus modes
	(partially fixes #152000)

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): Don't increment the focus
	sentinel for windows being freed, (idle_calc_showing): don't
	increment the focus sentinel for windows being minimized

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix unwanted loss of focus to the mouse window when using keynav
	(fixes #101190)

	* src/display.c (event_callback): Ignore EnterNotify events with
	xcrossing.mode of either NotifyGrab or NotifyUngrab

2004-09-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Focus correct window after minimizing via the tasklist (fixes
	#128200; see also #107681)

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): track the
	previously_focused_window

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): initialize
	previously_focused_window

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): clear the
	previously_focused_window if it's being freed,
	(meta_window_client_message): if we get a request to minimize the
	previously_focused_window and the focus_window is a dock or the
	desktop, focus the default window, (meta_window_notify_focus):
	update the previously_focused_window

2004-09-13  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* configure.in: post-release increment

	* configure.in: Added 'or' to ALL_LINGUAS.
   
2004-09-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Add a new write-up on making window focus consistent (see #152004)

	* doc/how-to-get-focus-right.txt: New document

	* rationales.txt: Remove references to focus bugs, instead point
	to doc/how-to-get-focus-right.txt

2004-09-06  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* rationales.txt: Add bugs regarding window focus

2004-08-29  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* NEWS: 2.8.4 release

2004-08-29  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/window.c (window_takes_focus_on_map): Disable
	focus-stealing-prevention for now; there are still some issues and
	hard code freeze is tomorrow...so this will have to wait until
	Gnome 2.10.

2004-08-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/compositor.c (meta_compositor_new): disable NameWindowPixmap
	stuff always for now, it seemed kind of busted
	(paint_screen): don't grab the server during repaint, adds to the
	speed, though only slightly.

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_set_window_background): factor out all
	the set_background stuff to one function; disable setting
	background to transparent, because it breaks existing themes. We
	need to add a flag in the theme XML file to say "start me with a
	transparent background"

2004-08-27  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Prevent an assertion failure that can occur after increasing the
	number of workspaces; also fix a warning and stacking order when a
	window is denied focus (fixes #150615)

	* src/window.c (meta_window_stack_just_below): the position of the
	window should be set equal to that of the one we want to be below,
	not 1 lower than that number

	* src/workspace.c (maybe_add_to_list): new function to add
	on_all_workspace windows to an mru_list, (meta_workspace_new):
	call maybe_add_to_list for all windows on the screen in order to
	initialize the mru_list

2004-08-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/frame.c: delete extra copy of find_argb_visual so things
	compile

	* src/compositor.c (HAS_NAME_WINDOW_PIXMAP): copy the
	XCompositeNameWindowPixmap() stuff from xcompmgr, though I can't
	say I really know what it's supposed to help with (painting the
	window border?)

2004-08-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/frame.c, src/theme.c: couple of cosmetic tweaks from
	resolving my local patch with the bugzilla patch from the 8-19
	entry below

2004-08-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: move the have_xrender variable initialization up
	in the file since it can be set as part of composite check

2004-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	Fixes from Rich Wareham

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): add render extension check
	to the display

	* src/display.c: check for render

	* configure.in: don't build compositing manager by default, don't
	want any nasty surprises; check for render separately from
	compositing manager

	* src/frame.c: use an ARGB visual when available for the window 
	frame, so we can be all cool-ass

2004-08-25  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Make dialogs that Metacity shows follow focus-stealing-prevention
	conventions. (fixes one issue in #149028; see comments 47-54)

	* src/delete.c (delete_ping_reply_func,
	delete_ping_timeout_func): Make callback functions take a
	timestamp arg, (delete_ping_timeout_func): pass the timestamp to
	metacity-dialog

	* src/display.c (meta_display_ping_timeout): add a timestamp to
	the call to the ping_timeout_func, (meta_display_ping_window,
	process_pong_message): add a timestamp to the call to the
	ping_reply_func

	* src/display.h (MetaWindowPingFunc typedef): add a timestamp to
	this function typedef

	* src/keybindings.c (error_on_command): require a timestamp and
	pass the timestamp on to metacity-dialog, (handle_run_command):
	pass a timestamp to error_on_command

	* src/metacity-dialog.c (copy_of_gdk_x11_window_set_user_time):
	new function (temporary; only for use while using gtk+-2.4),
	(kill_window_question, warn_about_no_sm_support,
	error_about_command): make these functions take a timestamp and
	call copy_of_gdk_x11_window_set_user_time, (main): require the
	first two args to the program to be "--timestamp <timestamp>"

	* src/session.c (warn_about_lame_clients_and_finish_inter): pass a
	timestamp of 0 to metacity-dialog to prevent focus (it's a popup
	not generated by and kind of user request).

Fri Aug 20 12:54:12 2004  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_end_grab_op): Move wireframe code
	before grab is released to prevent endless loops with fullscreen
	windows.

2004-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): track the last_xor_rect
	separately from the current window size, and then use that to 
	paint the wireframe including the frame, and taking into 
	account shaded windows.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_xor_rect): new function to compute
	the xor rect; it is not really 100% right, because it uses the
	frame dimensions from the window at the start of the move/resize.
	But probably won't break in practice.

2004-08-17  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "bs" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-08-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	top/bottom struts to compute gap (copy/paste bug).

2004-08-15  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_update_struts): Allow struts larger
	than 1/2 the screen width/height, as long as there's a minimum
	sized gap between them.  Patch from Bill Haneman <billh@gnome.org>
	for bug #144126.
	
2004-08-13 Gurban M. Tewekgeli  <gmtavakkoli@yahoo.com>
	* po/tk.po: Added Turkmen translation.

Sun Aug  8 14:20:00 2004  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	* src/frame.c (meta_frame_set_screen_cursor): Flush after setting

2004-08-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): activating the current workspace
	should be a no-op.  This prevents a race condition in focus window
	choice when activating a window via the taskbar.  Fix for #149589.

2004-08-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/window.c, src/window.h: Revert Rob's 2004-07-31 patch that
	ignored net_wm_user_time when unminimizing a window

	* src/window.c (meta_window_activate): If a nonzero timestamp is
	passed, update the window's net_wm_user_time accordingly.  (see
	comments 102-108 of bug 118372)

2004-08-07  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Remove some extraneous items that could sometimes appear in the
	window menu.  Fix for #144493.
	
	* src/menu.c (menuitems): Change the second separator to key on
	whether there are any workspaces.
	(meta_window_menu_new): use NULL label instead of 0 op to identify
	separator

	* src/window.c (meta_window_show_menu): Change the conditions on
	the directions to take into account "holes" in the workspace
	layout and also only set META_MENU_OP_WORKSPACES when there's more
	than one workspace.
	
2004-08-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_set_cursor): add XFlush() after
	setting cursor, #149413

2004-08-06  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): Focusing a window upon unshowing
	the desktop in various ways (panel applet or keybinding) was
	inconsistent for sloppy and click focus modes.  Fix this by
	calling meta_workspace_focus_default_window after unshowing the
	desktop via a _NET_SHOWING_DESKTOP message.  (resolves #149543)

2004-08-06  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_focus_default_window): prevent
	keyboard from "getting locked" upon workspace switch, by making
	sure that the no_focus_window has focus if no other window does.
	(fixes #147475)

2004-08-05  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Have newly mapped windows that are denied focus appear after the
	focused window in the alt-tab list.  This allows one to switch to
	such a window with a single alt-tab press.  (fixes #149366)
	
	* src/window.c (ensure_mru_position_after): new function,
	(meta_window_show): If newly mapped window is denied focus, call
	ensure_mru_position_after to make the window appear after the
	focus window in the mru list.

2004-08-05  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_stick): prepend window to mru list
	instead of appending, since making the window sticky should imply
	that it is the most recently used, not the least recently.  (fixes
	#149369)

2004-08-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* configure.in: post-release version bump (2.8.3) that I forgot to
	do yesterday.

2004-08-03  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Released 2.8.2

	* NEWS, README: update

2004-08-02  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Fix some bugs (reported in #120100) regarding the focus window
	when using the workspace switcher.
	
	* src/display.c (event_callback): When switching workspaces due to
	a _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP message, make sure to focus the default
	window as well.

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_focus_default_window,
	meta_workspace_focus_mru_window): Make DOCK or DESKTOP windows
	have lower priority than others when choosing a window to focus.
	(For the former function, this means don't focus them at all; for
	the latter, this means only focus them (via the
	meta_workspace_focus_top_window call) if no other mru window can
	be found.)

2004-07-31  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Fix bug that caused windows to not be focused on unminimizing
	because of user time support.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): initialize
	focus_despite_user_time bit
	(window_takes_focus_on_map): focus if focus_despite_user_time
	despite user time, interestingly enough
	(meta_window_show): reset focus_despite_user_time after showing

	* src/window.h (_MetaWindow): add focus_despite_user_time bit

2004-07-31  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Fix some support for EWMH hints, and fix USER_TIME support to
	include the DEMANDS_ATTENTION hint.  Also includes some code for
	implementing _NET_RESTACK_WINDOW and _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW, but
	this is disabled pending feature thaw.
	
	* COMPLIANCE: update with new information

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): add new hints to list

	* src/display.h (_MetaDisplay): Add new atoms to struct

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): update the list of support
	hints.
	(set_desktop_viewport_hint): new function sets the viewport hint
	to (0,0) as required by the spec for WMs with no viewport support.
	(set_desktop_geometry_hint): new function to set the desktop size
	hint to the size of the display, since we don't implement large
	desktop support, as required by the spec.
	(meta_screen_resize): update the geometry hint on screen resize

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): Initialize
	demands_attention state
	(set_net_wm_state): Set demands_attention hint in the window state
	(meta_window_show): If we don't pop up a window because of
	USER_TIME, set DEMANDS_ATTENTION on the window.
	(meta_window_focus): When a window receives focus, remove
	DEMANDS_ATTENTION hint
	(meta_window_client_message): Allow other apps to set
	DEMANDS_ATTENTION on a window.  Also, if the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
	hint includes a timestamp, use it.
	(update_net_wm_state): Read DEMANDS_ATTENTION state also

	* src/window.h (_MetaWindow): add wm_state_demands_attention bit.
	
2004-07-22  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: Add trailing quotes to keybinding
	explanation text.  Patch from Emil Soleyman-Zomalan.

Fri Jun 25 17:41:53 2004  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	* configure.in: Require startup-notification 0.7

2004-06-25  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* COMPLIANCE: indicate that _NET_WM_USER_TIME is now supported

2004-06-24  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/keybindings.c: (handle_toggle_desktop): Choose correct
	window to focus when "un-showing" the desktop.  Fixes #144900.

2004-06-24  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Make choice of focus window be consistent for each focus mode.
	Fixes #135810.

	* src/delete.c: (meta_window_delete): In some #if 0'ed code,
	replace meta_workspace_focus_mru_window with
	meta_workspace_focus_default_window (just in case the code becomes
	un-#if 0'ed out).

	* src/screen.c, src/screen.h: Change
	meta_screen_focus_mouse_window to meta_screen_get_mouse_window,
	and don't focus the window when found but rather return it.

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_free, meta_window_minimize): replace
	meta_workspace_focus_mru_window with
	meta_workspace_focus_default_window.

	* src/workspace.c: (meta_workspace_focus_default_window): Focus
	appropriately for the given focus method:
	   click-to-focus: focus MRU window (== toplevel window)
	   sloppy focus:   focus the window under the pointer if there is
	                   such a window, otherwise focus the mru window
	   mouse focus:    focus the window under the pointer if there is
	                   such a window, otherwise don't focus anything

2004-06-24  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/window.c: Avoid a race condition on the choice of window to
	focus after the previously focused window gets closed or
	minimized.  Fixes #131582.

2004-06-24  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: make naming for "move a window"/"move
	the window"/"move window" more consistent.  Patch from Michael
	Terry for #142235.

2004-06-24  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/session.c: Change meta_warning to meta_topic on failure to
	connect to a session manager.  Fixes #136218.

2004-06-17  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Add support for _NET_WM_USER_TIME
	
	* src/display.c:
	(meta_display_open): Add _NET_WM_USER_TIME to atom_names[],
	(event_callback): Manually set _NET_WM_USER_TIME upon KeyPress
	(doesn't work since keyboard isn't grabbed) and ButtonPress (does
	work), this is just a fallback for applications that don't update
	this themselves.

	* src/display.h: (struct _MetaDisplay): Add atom_net_wm_user_time field
	
	* src/screen.c: (meta_screen_apply_startup_properties): Check for
	TIMESTAMP provided from startup sequence as well.
	
	* src/stack.c:

	meta_window_set_stack_position_no_sync function followed immediately
	by calling meta_stack_sync_to_server.

	* src/window-props.c: 
	(init_net_wm_user_time), (reload_net_wm_user_time): new functions,
	(reload_wm_hints): also load atom_net_wm_user_time
	
	* src/window.c:
	new XSERVER_TIME_IS_LATER macro (accounts for timestamp wraparound),
	(meta_window_new_with_attrs): add timestamp attributes,
	(window_takes_focus_on_map): use TIMESTAMP from startup
	notification and _NET_WM_USER_TIME to decide whether to focus new
	windows,
	(meta_window_show): if app doesn't take focus on map, place it
	just below the focused window in the stack
	(process_property_notify): check for changes to _NET_WM_USRE_TIME,
	(meta_window_stack_just_below): new function
	
	* src/window.h:
	(_MetaWindow struct): new fields for initial_timestamp,
	initial_timestamp_set, net_wm_user_time_set, and net_wm_user_time,
	(meta_window_stack_just_below): new function

2004-06-21  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

	* src/common.h:
	* src/menu.c: (menu_closed), (activate_cb):
	* src/window.c: (menu_callback):
	Add a timestamp argument to menu functions and
	use it in meta_window_delete.
	
2004-06-21  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

	* src/window.c: (meta_window_client_message):
	Get the timestamp from the client message.

Sat Jun 19 02:21:08 2004  Soeren Sandmann  <sandmann@daimi.au.dk>

	Fix bug 143333, support for update counter spec, and 109362,
	schedule compensation events when events are ignored.
	
	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): Add _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST and
	_NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER atoms. Remove the old
	METACITY_SYNC_COUNTER stuff.
	(meta_display_begin_op): Setup the sync counter

	* src/xprops.c, src/xprops.h, src/window-props.c, src/display.h:
	Add new atoms.
	
	* src/window.c (send_sync_request): new function.
	(meta_window_move_resize_internal): send a sync request before
	resizing.
	(check_move_resize_frequence): Rework logic to also check the SYNC
	case. If an event is ignored return the remaining time.
	(update_resize_timeout): Timeout that gets called when a
	compensation event is scheduled.
	(uddate_resize): schedule compensation events when an event is
	ignored.
	(meta_window_handle_mouse_grap_op_event): When an alarm is
	received and sync was turned off, turn it back on.
	
	* src/window.h (struct MetaWindow)  Add some variables

2004-06-16  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: bump version, add the UNSTABLE note

	* Branch off GNOME 2.6, we are now officially unstable

2004-06-04  Jeff Waugh  <jdub@perkypants.org>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: Set titlebar_uses_system_font = false. The
	previous default was almost violent in its lack of appreciation for
	human beings. In fact, this entire setting should probably be removed, but
	for now, let's just fix the default. Permission granted by Havoc.

2004-05-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* configure.in: 2.8.1

	* NEWS: update

2004-05-02  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/metacity-dialog.c (warn_about_no_sm_support): make the no sm
	support warning dialog resizable, since the default GTK warning
	dialog not has default not resizable.  Fix for #141672 from
	Olivier Crete.

2004-04-29  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/prefs.c (change_notify): Add a value type check for the
	visual bell/audible bell gconf settings.  Patch from Jarrod
	Johnson for #141409.

2004-04-19  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>
	
        Syncing across this change from libwnck.
	Patch from Neil Muller <neil@dip.sun.ac.za> in bug #133979.
	
	* src/iconcache.c: (find_largest_sizes), (find_best_size):
	Don't down-size nitems from a gulong to an int. Fixes a
	crash with enlightenment, apparently.

2004-04-16  Iñaki Larrañaga  <dooteo@euskalgnu.org>

	* configure.in: Added "eu" (Basque) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-04-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/display.c: Prevent unwanted grab op from occurring.
	Previously, for some people under certain conditions, clicking and
	releasing the mouse button rapidly enough would result in Metacity
	starting a move operation due to ignoring the button release.
	This should fix that problem (it does for me).  See bug 136587.

2004-04-11  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* configure.in: Make the --enable-xinerama switch work properly.
	Fix for #138562 from foser@gentoo.org.
	
2004-04-09  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

        * configure.in: Added "gu" (Gujarati) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-27  Tõivo Leedjärv  <toivo@linux.ee>

	* configure.in: Added et to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-24  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

        * configure.in: Added "pa" (Punjabi) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: 2.8.0

	* NEWS: update

2004-03-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* rationales.txt: Bring up to date (see bug 136252).

2004-03-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: 2.7.1

2004-03-04  Paisa Seeluangsawat  <paisa@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: Added "th" (Thai) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-01  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/stack.c (compute_layer): don't promote due to transiency; we
	handle that elsewhere now.
	(ensure_above): perform layer promotion here as well as stack
	position promotion.  Note that this means that we need to do stack
	constraints now on layer change now.
	(get_maximum_layer_of_ancestor): remove function
	(max_layer_func): remove function
	(MaxLayerData): remove struct

2004-02-28  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Revert 2/27 patch for layer promotion.

2004-02-27  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): only move on MRU list
	if the window belongs on the workspace, since the FocusIn event
	could be for a window whose workspace we've since switched away
	from.  Possible fix for #122016.

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_contains_window): search for the
	workspace in window->workspaces rather than the window in
	workspace->windows.  Since the number of workspaces is at most 36,
	this is a O(1) lookup rather than a O(n) lookup.  Sorry; couldn't
	resist.

2004-02-27  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: Change
	move_to_workspace_left/right/up/down keybindings to
	<Control><Alt><Shift> arrow to avoid conflicting with new
	keybindings in spacial nautilus.

2004-02-27  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Handle layer promotion of transient descendants of layer-promoted
	windows to also be layer promoted, using a simple iterative
	algorithm.

	* src/stack.c (compute_layer): change name to promote_layer, and
	convert to simply perform any necessary layer promotion without
	computing the standalone layer.
	(max_layer_func): use window->layer instead of
	get_standalone_layer
	(get_maximum_layer_of_ancestor): use window->layer instead of
	get_standalone_layer
	(meta_stack_ensure_sorted): implement iterative algorithm,
	explained in a long comment.
	
	* src/window.h: add a tmp_layer field used by stack.c for
	determining if the stack is dirty or not, since maintaining this
	information in meta_stack_ensure_sorted is no longer practical.

2004-02-23  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Add my copyright notice to a number of files on which it should
	already exist.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): modify code to move to
	front of MRU list so that we can have an assert that it was there
	in the first place.  This code may be causing some crashes.  See
	#131196.
	
2004-02-22  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "en_CA" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-02-19  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/prefs.h: remove trailing comma in MetaKeyBindingAction enum.
	Fix for #134868 thanks to bugzilla-gnome@thewrittenword.com.

2004-02-16  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (update_move): reset drag state after shaking loose
	or reattaching.  Fix for #132625.

2004-02-15  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): Actually translate a message,
	don't just mark it for translation.

2004-02-14  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/workspace.c: When moving a window to a different workspace,
	prepend it to the mru list insted of appending it.  Fixes #134368.

2004-02-14  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	If we're moving a window and receive a _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP
	message indicating a workspace switch, bring along the drag window
	to the new workspace, solving a potentially weird bug where the
	window would be lost on the old workspace.  This also makes it
	possible to implement edge flipping in an external program with
	just a few lines of code.  Patch for #131630 from ed@catmur.co.uk.
	
	* src/keybindings.c (switch_to_workspace): remove function -- no
	longer needed.
	(handle_activate_workspace): call meta_workspace_activate instead
	of switch_to_workspace

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_activate_with_focus): if we're
	in a move grab op, bring along the drag window.

2004-02-14  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* configure.in: Add configure option to not even try using
	xinerama, to make metacity buildable on systems with no shared
	library version of the xinerama libraries.  Patch for #134203 from
	Julio M. Merino Vidal.

2004-02-01  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* COMPLIANCE: Bring up to date with current draft EWHM.

2004-01-27  James M. Cape  <jcape@ignore-your.tv>

	* src/themes/Esco/metacity-theme-1.xml: Use the 'utility' frame
	for dialogs too.

2004-01-24  James M. Cape  <jcape@ignore-your.tv>

	* src/themes/Esco/metacity-theme-1.xml: Updated this theme.

2004-01-21  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): Removed some duplicate
	entries.

2004-01-17  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: Default binding removed for
	toggle_shaded, since we don't have anything in the graphical UI
	for it any more.

2004-01-17  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_show_menu): Don't show
	left/right/up/down if a window is sticky.  Make "On Top"
	insensitive for docks, splash screens, and desktops since it has
	no effect anyway.

2004-01-10  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: update default
	action_double_click_titlebar to be toggle_maximize instead of
	toggle_shade.  See #131126.
	
2004-01-10  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/constraints.c (meta_window_constrain): if we maximize after
	placement, and the window is too big to fix in the work area,
	define a sane saved_rect approximately with dimensions
	three-quarters approximately three quarters the size of the work
	area.  This avoids the problem where large windows would
	unmaximize and actually get bigger.  See #93590.

2004-01-09  Thomas Fitzsimmons  <fitzsim@redhat.com>

	Add _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS and _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS.

	* src/display.c: include xprops.h
	(process_request_frame_extents): new function
	(meta_display_open): add _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS and
	_NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS atoms
	(event_callback): handle frame extents message

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): add atom_net_frame_extents
	and atom_net_request_frame_extents

	* src/theme.c (meta_pango_font_desc_get_text_height): make font_desc
	parameter const

	* src/ui.c: include prefs.h
	(meta_ui_theme_get_frame_borders): new function

	* src/window.c (update_net_frame_extents): new function
	(meta_window_move_resize_internal): update frame extents
	property when frame geometry changes

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): add atom_net_frame_extents
	and atom_net_request_frame_extents

2004-01-09  Calum Benson  <calum.benson@sun.com>

	* src/themes/Atlanta/metacity-theme-1.xml:

	Ensure Atlanta window buttons get larger when using large
	print themes. Fixes #123469.

2003-01-04  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Maintain the button grab for sloppy and mouse focus all the time.
	This fixes a number of problem introduced by trying to drop the
	grab; we now do this only for click to focus mode.  This has the
	unfortunate effect that #102209 reappears for sloppy and mouse
	focus, but this seems unavoidable, because of limitations in the X
	protocol.  See #115072.

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_focus_window_button): #if 0 the
	section on not grabbing unless in click-to-focus mode.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): drop focus button grab
	on FocusIn and acquire it on FocusOut only when in click-to-focus
	mode.
	
2004-01-03  Robert Sedak  <robert.sedak@sk.htnet.hr>

        * configure.in: Added "hr" in ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-01-02  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* README: Update reference to EWMH.

	* HACKING: Add a reference to COMPLIANCE and to the ICCCM and
	EWHM.

2003-12-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/compositor.c (process_reparent): handle ReparentNotify, and
	add a lot of debug output.

2003-12-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/compositor.c (meta_compositor_process_event): change to
	track all children of the root window, not only mapped children;
	this keeps us from losing track of the stacking order

	* src/display.c (event_callback): don't do any of the compositor
	event handling inline, do it all in compositor.c

2003-12-21  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net

	* src/main.c (main): fix minor punctuation error in a string.  Fix
	for #129805.

2003-12-20  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Reorganize the window menu according to discussion on #110904.
	The workspace name mnemonic chunk of the patch is thanks to
	Jonathan Blandford.
	
	* src/common.h: add MENU_OP_ABOVE, MENU_OP_UNABOVE, MENU_UP_MOVE_TO_*
	menu ops.

	* src/core.c (meta_core_get_menu_accelerator): add accelerator for
	the new menu ops.

	* src/menu.c: add checked attribute in _MenuItem struct to display
	a checkmark next to a menu item.  Add the new menu items to
	menuitems.
	(get_workspace_name_with_accel): Add mnemonics even to renamed
	workspaces.
	(menu_item_new): provide support for the checked attribute
	(meta_window_menu_new): construct new submenu for workspace
	switching.

	* src/window.c (menu_callback): implement support for the new menu
	ops.
	(meta_window_show_menu): don't use the OP_*SHAPE operations, and

	grab_wireframe_active to FALSE.  Fix for #128090.

2003-12-17  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/tabpopup.c (meta_ui_tab_popup_new): Don't try to call
	utf8_strndup on a null title for an entry.  Fix for #128566.

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_free): Call g_list_free on the
	mru_list, since with sticky windows that MRU list could well not
	be emtpy.  See #122016.

2003-12-13  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): set on_all_workspaces
	in all cases _before_ adding to the workspaces, so that windows
	initially on all workspaces are added correctly to the MRU lists.
	Fix for #120907.

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_add_window): handle sticky
	windows so that we add to add mru lists if needed
	(meta_workspace_remove_window): handle sticky windows so that they
	are removed from all mru lists if needed.

2003-12-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): unstick window to get it out of
	mru_list it should not be in; assert that window has been removed
	from all mru_list. Perhaps fixes #122016 crash.

2003-11-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* fix up compositing manager to somewhat work

2003-11-26  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* COMPLIANCE: fix a couple of minor typos.

2003-11-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/compositor.c (meta_compositor_new): fix the extension checks

2003-11-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/iconcache.c (meta_icon_cache_init): init prev_mask field

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): init xgroup_leader
	prior to use

2003-11-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_begin_grab_op): add an event_serial
	argument and use it when the pointer is already grabbed
	automatically on the button press. May fix bug #126871

2003-11-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* Apply patch from Gregory Merchan to avoid using CurrentTime when
	setting input focus. Bug #108881

2003-11-23  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/compositor.c: move xcompmgr code in here (minus drop
	shadows), untested since Keith's server just crashes at the
	moment. "It compiles"

2003-11-20  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): new function

	* src/display.c, src/screen.c: create the compositor and feed
	windows and events to it

2003-11-20  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): revert the change here
	
2003-11-17  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net

	* src/window.c (set_allowed_actions_hint): increment i between
	resize and fullscreen.

2003-11-16  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Create COMPLIANCE document describing metacity specification
	compliance.  Right now gives detailed EWMH compliance; still need
	to add ICCCM compliance information.  Also some minor fixes to
	bring metacity into compliance on some points.
	
	* COMPLIANCE: new file

	* src/display.h, src/display.c (meta_display_open),
	src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): add
	atom_net_wm_action_fullscreen and atom_net_wm_action_minimize

	* src/window.c (set_allowed_actions_hint): some fixes to which
	hints to set and add fullscreen and minimize.
	
2003-11-16  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): add paranoia check to
	make sure a window is really on a workspace before inserting it at
	the beginning of the MRU list.  Maybe there's a race condition
	with focusing and workspace switching.  Hopefully a fix for
	#122016.

2003-11-15  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (main): fix warning

	* src/compositor.c: add a new file to contain compositing manager
	functionality; not yet implemented at all.

2003-11-15  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Inherit visual from frame window so that metacity will work with
	the new compositing manager extension work by Keith on
	freedesktop.org, so that ARGB windows can be full
	alpha-transparent without a metacity frame getting drawn in the
	background.  In the long term, we need to actually set alpha
	values when drawing the frame so that it will really work; this is
	a stopgap solution.  Patch from Keith Packard; see Bug 126875.
	
	* src/frame.c (meta_window_ensure_frame): pass client visual to
	frame.

	* src/ui.[ch] (meta_ui_create_frame_window): add new xvisual
	parameter and use it to create new window.
	
2003-11-15  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (update_net_wm_type): don't set window->type_atom
	here so that the type-inference code will actually be called.  Fix
	for #126873 from Keith Packard.

2003-11-08  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_move_resize_internal): configure frame
	first if we grow more than we shrink combined in both dimensions.
	Patch from Soren Sandmann for #108925.

2003-11-07  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/place.c (meta_window_place): use maximize_after_placement to
	automaximize in meta_window_place; avoids a problem with not
	recalculating the frame geometry after auto-maximizing.

2003-11-07  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/window.c (window_should_be_showing): show the window if it's
	a transient of a dock or desktop, since otherwise such windows are
	invisible in show desktop mode.  Fix for #124648.

2003-11-07  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/main.c (main): Try harder to find a theme in the event that
	the theme in the preference cannot be found.  Patch from Marcin
	Krzyzanowski.  See #125815.

	* src/place.c (meta_window_place): use "visual" centering for
	dialog placement and clip new dialogs to an xinerama workspace.
	Fix for #118336.

2003-10-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): patch to avoid creating
	stick/unstick menu items when only one workspace, bug #116563
	from Michael Terry

2003-10-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): if a window is focused
	which is not either a dock or a transient in the same group as a
	dock, shuffle all dock/desktop windows to the end of the MRU list
	so they won't annoyingly get focus all the time. #123816

2003-10-15  Yukihiro Nakai  <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	Gettextize metacity-theme-viewer. #121747

	* src/theme-viewer.c: gettextize.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add src/theme-viewer.c

2003-10-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

        In the "prefs cause code complexity" department, here's a "sloppy
	focus die die die" kind of moment.

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_focus_window_button): don't
	grab in sloppy focus mode, since we were dropping the grab on
	window enter anyway this just removes races from the current
	behavior.

	* src/display.c (prefs_changed_callback): ungrab/grab on focus
	mode changes, since we treat sloppy and click differently.
	
2003-10-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

        Merge reduced_resources mode patch from the branch. Offers
	wireframe and no-animations.
	
	* src/window.c (implement_showing): no animation if we are 
	in reduced resources mode

	* src/prefs.c: add REDUCED_RESOURCES pref

	* src/window.c (meta_window_update_keyboard_resize): fix to 
	modify grab_anchor_window_pos to grab_wireframe_rect if 
	appropriate instead of window->rect

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): add grab_start_serial used
	to avoid responding to events that occurred prior to the grab
	initialization.

	Still broken in various ways, specifically EnterNotify that
	occurred prior to XGrabPointer is processed as if it occurred
	after.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_update_keyboard_move): add this
	instead of meta_window_warp_pointer() crack

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_update_wireframe): draw a kind of
	grid for the wireframe, instead of just a rectangle, like twm

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): line width of 3 for the XOR gc

        "Reduced resources" mode based on wireframe patch from
	Erwann Chenede. Still pretty buggy.
	
	* src/keybindings.c (process_keyboard_move_grab)
	(process_keyboard_resize_grab): add gruesome wireframe hacks

	* src/display.c (meta_display_end_grab_op): end wireframe
	(meta_display_begin_grab_op): begin wireframe

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_end_wireframe) 
	(meta_effects_update_wireframe, meta_effects_begin_wireframe): 
	routines to draw the wireframe stuff

	* src/window.c (window_should_be_showing): hide window when 
	doing wireframe, commented out as it breaks grab
	* src/window.c (meta_window_refresh_resize_popup): handle wireframe

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): create a screen->root_xor_gc 
	for use in drawing wireframes
	
	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_push_delay_exposes): repaint
	everything before we delay

2003-10-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_begin_grab_op): initialize
	display->grab_have_pointer to FALSE, previously I think you could
	get a case where we didn't have the grab and thought we did.
	Bugs were reported with this happening. Of course we still have
	the "why did the grab fail" problem, but it should be less
	noticeable with this fixed.

2003-10-06  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	* src/constraints.c (constraint_onscreen_*_func): disable onscreen
	resize constraints for right, left, and bottom, since there is no
	way to violate onscreen constraints by resizing in these
	directions and the code to implement the constraints made some
	incorrect assumptions.  Fix for #120701, #120756, #123165,
	#123631, #123838.

2003-10-06  Žygimantas Beručka  <uid0@tuxfamily.org>

	* src/ui.h (META_PRIORITY_RESIZE): add this between GTK
	resize/redraw priorities

	* src/display.c (meta_display_queue_retheme_all_windows): remove

	* src/async-getprop.c (async_get_property_handler): attempt to fix
	this to return the data as an array of long even on 64-bit as with
	XGetWindowProperty() breakage, bug #114035, credit to Gwenole
	Beauchesne for tracking down.

2003-09-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/xprops.c (cvtINT16toInt): fix the 64-bit check not to use 
	macros from the X tree that don't get set

	real bug)
	
	* src/ui.c (meta_gdk_pixbuf_get_from_pixmap): fix warning that
	probably explains remaining crash on bug #116923. Jeez, need to 
	use -Werror here or something.

        Fix #103575, spawn child processes on proper screen.
	
	* src/keybindings.c (error_on_command): pass --screen to

	the screen you launch it from

	* src/delete.c (delete_ping_timeout_func): pass --screen to
	metacity-dialog

2003-09-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): when focus on root window
	becomes None, set it to something other than None so keybindings
	keep working and print a warning about how some application sucks.
	#84564
	(event_callback): Fix debug spew to print focus event details
	properly
	(meta_display_open): when setting initial focus, always use
	RevertToPointerRoot and fix the focus if it's None or PointerRoot

2003-09-26  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Add -DMETACITY_LIBDIR to support loading of modules
	* src/main.c: Add functions find_accessibility_module, 
	accessibility_invoke_module and accessibility_invoke

	meta_workspace_focus_mru_window
	(meta_window_minimize): call meta_workspace_focus_mru_window

2003-08-20  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	* src/constraints.c (meta_window_constrain): do northwest resize
	when maximizing and fullscreening to avoid potential "off-by-one"
	problems.

2003-08-19  Rob Adams  <robadams@uclu.edu>

	* src/stack.c (get_standalone_layer): put windows with

	Fix for #119988.
	
2003-08-15  Ray Strode  <halfline@hawaii.rr.com>

	Changed MRU list to be per workspace instead of per display, so
	sticky windows don't hijack the window focus after workspace

2003-08-14  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	Allow windows that are too tall for the workarea to break the
	onscreen constraints just enough so that their bottom edges can be
	made visible.  Fix for #106740.  Also, changes constraints to
	constrain the resize and then the move to avoid complexities in
	the code for the above fix.

	* src/constraints.c (get_outermost_onscreen_positions)
	Compute the "effective" height of the work area and the minimum
	size for the window to compute a value by which a window is
	allowed to violate the top constraint.
	(meta_window_constrain): convert to a resize then a move instead
	of a move then resize.

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): don't select for button
	press/release events, as that keeps other clients from doing so,

	Patch from Andreas Volz.

2003-08-08  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

2003-06-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_invalidate_work_area): nuke the
	lists of struts here, to improve confidence that we never try to

	code more robust against future mods)

	* src/window.c (meta_window_update_struts): replace magic "75"

	EWMH draft specification.  See #86682.  Also, fix a bug involving
	work area invalidation on metacity startup.  Fix for #108497.
	Finally, some minor fixes for full screen windows.

	* src/window.h: Add new MetaStruts structure to store strut rects
	for a window.  Remove has_struts and do_not_cover flag, and
	support new MetaStruts instead of the four ints.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): change initialization to work
	with new struts.  Also, move meta_window_update_struts call to
	after the workspaces are initialized to fix #108497.  Remove
	do_not_cover and related code.
	(process_property_notify): add strut_partial
	(update_struts): change function name to meta_window_update_struts
	and expose in external MetaWindow API.  Support partial width

	rects to compute the constraints that apply to a particular
	window.
	(constraint_hint_applies_func): don't do hints constraints on
	fullscreen windows
	(update_position_limits): for maximized windows use the work areas
	to set the position limits; for other windows rely on the struts
	constraints to be computed later in
	get_outermost_onscreen_positions
	(meta_window_constrain): don't apply aspect ratio hints to full
	screen windows

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): add _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL atom

	_window_intersects_ to _rect_intersects_ which is more useful now.
	(meta_screen_resize_func): update struts on windows with struts
	since struts are relative to the screen size, and this function is
	called when the screen size updates.

	* src/screen.h (meta_screen_rect_intersects_xinerama): change

	#106123 from Julio Merino

2003-06-12  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	Remove legacy support for Gnome 1 hints, since we deem it unlikely
	that anyone is running a current metacity with Gnome 1.  The
	removed hints are _WIN_WORKSPACE, _WIN_LAYER, _WIN_PROTOCOLS,
	_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK, and _WIN_HINTS.  Thanks to Ben Jansens
	for much of this patch.

2003-06-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): make raise-on-click explicitly 
	only happen in click to focus mode.

	* src/window.c (update_move): apply patch from Jurg Billeter to
	allow you to "shake loose" maximized windows and move them between
	Xinerama heads. #93586

	* src/display.c: delete event_queue_callback

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): get rid of
	grab_current_window_pos and grab_current_root_[xy] as I could find
	absolutely no code using them for anything. They were just sort of
	randomly assigned to for no apparent reason.
	
	* src/display.c (event_callback): double-click timeout is per
	screen, so get the screen and pass screen->ui to
	meta_ui_get_double_click_timeout()

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_get_double_click_timeout): take a MetaUI
	argument so we get the right settings for each screen
	(meta_ui_get_drag_threshold): new function

2003-06-09  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	Revamp placement policy for windows that are maximized when they
	are mapped, including windows that set a hint to be maximized or
	windows that are auto-maximized using our heuristic.  See #111902.

	* src/window.h: add new flag maximize_after_placement and new
	function meta_window_maximize_internal.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): initialize
	maximize_after_placement to FALSE and remove the automaximize
	heuristic.
	(meta_window_maximize_internal): new function accepts a saved_rect
	argument to be used as the new saved_rect for the window, and does
	not queue a move_resize.
	(meta_window_maximize): re-implement using
	meta_window_maximize_internal.
	(update_net_wm_state): If a window has a maximize hint set on
	startup set maximize_after_placement to TRUE

	* src/constraints.c (meta_window_constrain): Update the xinerama
	information in the ConstraintInfo after placing the window, and
	maximize the window after placement if
	window->maximize_after_placement

	* src/place.c (find_first_fit): take a natural xinerama list as an
	argument instead of generating it here
	(constrain_placement): remove function, since it is no longer
	needed
	(meta_window_place): generate the natural xinerama list here and
	pass it into find_first_fit.  If find_first_fit fails, use the
	list to find empty xineramas where we can place windows that may
	be maximized later.  This makes maximized windows follow the
	correct placement policy.  Move the automaximize heuristic here.

2003-06-09  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	* src/metacity-dialog.c (warn_about_no_sm_support): install an
	alarm to timeout the no-sm-dialog after 4 minutes of inactivity.

	enabled.

2003-06-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): drop the mouse button
	grabs for the focused window; we'll see if this breaks anything. 
	It should fix #102209

Fri Jun  6 19:27:53 2003  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@gnome.org>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: fix the location of the schemas file.

2003-06-04  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): don't be stupid and set
	window->group = NULL after calling meta_window_compute_group.

	* src/group.c (meta_window_get_group): assert that window->group
	!= NULL in here instead of computing the group to ensure
	robustness.

2003-06-04  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	Precompute groups to guarantee that meta_group_list_windows always
	returns the correct list of windows.  See Bug #96973

	* src/window.h: change cached_group variable to group

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): change cached_group to group and
	call meta_window_compute_group
	
	* src/groups.c (meta_window_get_group): simply return
	window->group rather than computing it and returning
	window->cached_group
	(meta_window_compute_group): new function computes window->group.
	Designed to be called once from meta_window_new
	(remove_window_from_group): change cached_group to group
	(meta_window_group_leader_changed): call meta_window_compute_group
	instead of meta_window_get_group

2003-05-29  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	Use a new property _METACITY_SENTINEL to eliminate a race
	condition that causes focus to behave badly with sloppy/mouse
	focus when lots of windows are mapped/unmapped, such as with a
	workspace switch.  The EnterNotify events on a display are ignored
	until the PropertyNotify sent after all the window maps is
	received.  This is a fix for #110970.
	
	* src/display.[ch]: New _METACITY_SENTINEL atom.
	(event_callback): ignore EnterNotify if the sentinel isn't clear,
	and decrement the sentinel counter when the PropertyNotify is
	received.
	(meta_display_increment_focus_sentinel): new function.  Increments
	the sentinel counter and updates the property on a root window on
	this display.
	(meta_display_decrement_focus_sentinel): Decrement the sentinel
	counter.
	(meta_display_focus_sentinel_clear): returns whether the sentinel
	counter is zero.

	* src/window.c (idle_calc_showing): after showing windows, call
	meta_display_increment_focus_sentinel on each display for windows
	to be shown.

	* src/workspace.[ch] (meta_workspace_activate_with_focus): new
	function activates a workspace and focuses a particular window
	after the workspace is activated.
	(meta_workspace_activate): now just a wrapper for
	meta_workspace_activate_with_focus

	* src/keybindings.c: use new meta_workspace_activate_with_focus
	function to ensure that focus will follow the focused window
	through the workspace switch.

2003-05-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/theme-parser.c (meta_theme_load): s/int/gsize/ for

	* src/ui.c, src/ui.h: 
	add function meta_ui_get_double_click_timeout for looking up
	the global double-click speed.

	* src/display.c, src/display.h: remove double_click_time
	field from MetaDisplay and use meta_ui_get_double_click_timeout 
	instead.

2003-05-29  Rob Adams  <robadams@ucla.edu>

	* src/main.c (main): chdir to the user's home directory on
	startup.  See #113755.

	* src/stack.c (get_standalone_layer): a window should be in the

	fullscreen sized.  Fix for #104369.

	* src/stack.c (is_focused_foreach): foreach used by
	get_standalone_layer to find focused transient descendants.
	
2003-05-20  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>
	
	* src/keybindings.c (meta_change_keygrab): the mask 
	display->ignored_modifier_mask wasn't being bound, 
	due to "<" instead of "<=" (most people didn't notice
	as display->ignored_modifier_mask included Scroll_Lock).
	Red Hat bugzilla #91301 reported by Youssef Makki

	* src/display.c (meta_change_button_grab): make corresponding

	* src/xprops.c: add support for getting XSizeHints

2002-10-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c, src/display.c: store the window menu on the
	display and blow it away when a window closes, so we don't 
	get funny stuck menus. Patch from Martin Garton #87514

2002-10-27  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Make XRandr detection work better.

2002-10-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	after we've started unmanaging the window

2002-10-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/iconcache.c: include config.h

	* src/group.c: include config.h

        Add "busy cursor on app startup" support, conditionally - works

	a GTK patch that's not in yet.
	
	* src/screen.c: monitor startup events and set busy cursor if
	appropriate

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): create SnDisplay

	Optimizations for managing new windows (do not all take effect if
	METACITY_DEBUG=1). Bug #96404
	
	* src/keybindings.c (meta_change_keygrab): use error trap nesting
	and conditionalize on meta_is_verbose() to avoid a ton of XSync

	* src/display.c (meta_change_button_grab): ditto
	
	Throughout: move to new error trap setup to save on XSync calls, 
	new setup is:
	
	* src/errors.c (meta_error_trap_push_with_return): new function, 
	an error trap that needs to care about return value and thus 
	sync even if an outer trap still exists
	(meta_error_trap_pop_with_return): new function
	(meta_error_trap_pop): add "last_request_was_roundtrip" 
	argument allowing us to avoid XSync() if we just did 
	a GetProperty or whatever.

	* src/util.c (meta_warning): flush the warning file descriptor
	
	* src/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define G_LOG_DOMAIN
	
2002-10-20  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	fix from Stephane Chauveau 

2002-10-19  Jeremy Katz  <katzj@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: make Xrandr check less noisy

	* src/resizepopup.c: Clear out all the weird tickmark cruft, 
	saves us about 2.5K of binary size, whee

	multihead-safe #94349
	
2002-10-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/keybindings.c (do_choose_window): don't start the cycle
	process if the binding for switching windows has no modifier bits, 
	just focus the window immediately.

	* src/prefs.c, src/keybindings.c: add a keybinding to move between
	windows that goes in the opposite direction.  This is mostly
	useful if you want to bind unmodified keys to the switch windows
	functions, e.g. if you have "Forward" and "Back" keys on your
	keyboard. Patch from Shilad Sen <shilad sourcelight com>

2002-10-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/prefs.c, src/frames.c: add "what happens when you double
	click the titlebar" setting, patch from Sean Middleditch bug
	#95625.  This is basically an "add Windows emulation mode" patch.

2002-10-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: move window-click to Super+click not
	Alt+click by default. Super should be the Windows key on keyboards
	that have one and are so configured.  Prepare for the FAQ on this.

2002-10-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (constrain_size): fix min aspect handling, 
	patch from Martin Garton #94943

	* configure.in: Added hu to ALL_LINGUAS.

2002-10-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (constrain_stacking): replace the old
	apply_constraints with wacky new approach involving graphing all
	the constraints then walking the graph.  Fixes #94876 and probably
	other stacking bugs as well, thanks to Arvind for tracking down
	the issue.

	(compute_layer): add FIXME and reference to bug #96140

2002-10-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/stack.c (apply_constraints): don't place
	transient-for-whole-group windows above _each other_, only 
	above other windows in the group that aren't themselves
	transient-for-whole-group. Should help with part of #94876	

2002-10-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/stack.c (apply_constraints): fix memory leak of
	group_windows, and don't use the variable name "tmp" twice. Shadow
	variables bad.

2002-10-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/tools/metacity-window-demo.c (dialog_cb): add code to create
	big stacks of dialogs transient for each other, for testing.

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_get_workspace_by_index): new function

	* src/screen.h (struct _MetaScreen): move workspace list, and 
	showing_desktop flag, to be per-screen

	* src/window.c (window_query_root_pointer): return whether pointer
	is on window's screen
	(meta_window_handle_mouse_grab_op_event): don't use coordinates
	from other screens when updating a window operation on the current 
	screen. I can't believe no one has reported this...

2002-10-16  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_client_message): update window layer
	when above/below state is changed. Fixed by Ross Burton.

2002-10-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): Ignore EnterNotify events when
	the detail field is set to NotifyInferior.  Fixes #95747.

2002-10-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/prefs.c: Add button layout gconf key
	(change_notify): use some "else if" instead of "if" where we
	should have been

2002-10-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): don't raise window on button 2
	click, only on button 1 and button 3.

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_button_press_event): lower on button 2
	press on frame

	* src/core.c (meta_core_user_lower): new function

2002-10-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (window_is_fullscreen_size): make the checks here
	allow windows larger than the screen in addition to
	exactly-screen-size

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): delete the "try to
	auto-enter-fullscreen-state" hack here, because it was broken, and
	the changes to the stacking code to move screen-size focused
	windows to the fullscreen layer should work better.
	(meta_window_new): remove auto-fullscreen hack from here too

2002-10-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (apply_constraints): also keep utility/menu/toolbar
	windows above their whole group.

	(get_standalone_layer): don't use META_LAYER_FOCUSED_WINDOW, but
	only use META_LAYER_FULLSCREEN while the fullscreen window has
	focus.  Also, put screen-sized windows in the fullscreen layer,
	even if we didn't dare to actually put them in the fullscreen
	state.

2002-10-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

        Add a modifier key preference for the Alt+click stuff. 
	Can be set to "disabled" as well.
	
	* src/run-metacity.sh: load .Xmodmap in the Xnest if it exists

	* src/display.c (meta_display_ungrab_window_buttons): ungrab
	AnyModifier in case the modifier changed since we grabbed
	(meta_display_open): rearrange code to use meta_display_close() to
	mop up when we can't find any screens, avoiding the need to 
	keep the bail-out code in sync with meta_display_close.

	* src/keybindings.c (devirtualize_modifiers): move this function
	to a public place in display.c

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: add setting for the modifier key 
	to use for Alt+left/middle/right click.

	* src/prefs.c (update_binding): add a missing newline to a warning
	(meta_prefs_get_mouse_button_mods): new function	

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_parse_modifier): new function

2002-10-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/async-getprop.c: don't include unportable Xproto.h, fix from
	Glynn Foster.

2002-10-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/async-getprop.c: change to add only one _XAsyncHandler per
	display, speeding things up a bit.

2002-10-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/async-getprop.c: Add wacky hack suggested by Keith Packard
	to get X properties asynchronously. Not actually used by metacity
	yet, but thinking about it.	

2002-10-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: actually link to RANDR_LIBS

2002-10-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): do XRRUpdateConfiguration() 
	if we have RandR extension, else poke in Xlib's screen struct to
	update the screen size.

	* configure.in: fix a bogus overwrite of cppflags, 
	add a check for RandR extension
	
2002-10-04  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_change_workspace): call
	meta_window_unstick before adding window to workspace.
	(menu_callback): call meta_workspace_activate before
	meta_window_change_workspace.  This would avoid us running an
	extra loop for determining the window workspace list.

	Patches from Jeyasudha and Arvind. Fixes #92575

2002-10-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/themes/Esco/metacity-theme-1.xml: only specify the 
	middle backgrounds, let left/right fall back to middle

	routines when missing the left/right button backgrounds.
	(button_rect): fix to handle drawing middle button backgrounds
	(meta_frame_style_draw): draw middle background once per middle
	button

2002-10-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Button-reordering patch. Has all the code except actually

	themes.

	* src/window.c (check_moveresize_frequency): handle the case where
	the clock is set backward

2002-10-01  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

2002-09-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	Solaris, patch from Satyajit Kanungo

2002-09-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	Loader for <Super> <Hyper> <Meta> parsing, #93005

2002-09-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.h (META_MINIMIZE_ANIMATION_LENGTH): shorten minimize
	animation a bit

2002-09-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	(meta_screen_resize): implement this, to be called from display.c
	on screen resize

	* src/display.c (event_callback): handle ConfigureNotify on root
	windows

2002-09-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (get_standalone_layer): re-enable the FOCUSED_WINDOW
	layer, should now work correctly.

2002-09-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c, src/stack.c: Rewrite stack code to work a lot
	differently. Should be better now, and not lose relative positions
	of windows when moving among layers. Also should now be possible
	to get session management to restore the stacking order.  Probably
	breaks some stuff, and makes all the stack.c changes I made
	yesterday sort of irrelevant.

2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (get_standalone_layer): Temporarily disable use of
	the FOCUSED_WINDOW layer, because given the fact that moving
	multiple windows into the same layer changes the Z-order of those
	windows, it was breaking click-to-focus.

2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_focus_top_window): raise the focused
	window, since it may not be the window on top, given the below
	change.

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_get_default_focus_window): make this
	more complex to prefer to focus the transient parent, followed by
	other windows in group, followed by topmost non-dock, followed by
	dock. Previously was just topmost non-dock followed by dock
	ignoring groups and transiency.

2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/place.c (constrain_placement): constrain placement to try to
	keep windows from going offscreen to the right/bottom

	* src/stack.c (compute_layer): rearrange the logic here to say
	that a window must always be in at least as high a layer as any of
	its transient parents or group members, rather than special-casing
	fullscreen. Also, group_member_is_fullscreen was leaking the list
	of group members every time, a fairly major memory leak.
	
2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/themes/Makefile.am (THEMES): use AgingGorilla not Gorilla
	(renamed on the CVS server)

2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

        Try to handle Solaris Xinerama, all coded blind, someone 
	on Solaris will need to debug the typos.
	
	* src/display.c: updates for Solaris Xinerama

	* src/screen.c: updates for Solaris Xinerama

	* configure.in: make Xinerama check more complicated to catch
	Solaris Xinerama

2002-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (update_transient_for): keep a flag 
	transient_parent_is_root_window for whether the
	root-window-as-parent convention was used.

2002-09-25  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

 	* src/stack.c (sort_window_list): Keep dialogs without

2002-09-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/metacity.schemas.in: Change short desc of switch_windows and
	cycle_windows to be different

2002-09-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	through the loop - doh. Fix from readams@hmc.edu for #90799.

	after the first. Also from readams@hmc.edu

2002-09-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	(meta_window_maximize): use new function

2002-09-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	all other windows, in click-to-focus mode. #93022

	* src/workspace.c (meta_screen_ensure_workspace_popup): rename

	code factored out of libwnck, needs wiring up to tabpopup.c

	handle_workspace_forward since there's no directionality here	
	(handle_workspace_switch): add a FIXME about how screwed it is

	no tab involved here.

	* src/common.h (enum): have only one grab op for all workspace

	to the Ctrl+Alt+arrows shortcuts. #83940

2002-06-08  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): select key press/release on the

	keybindings when no window is focused. Still doesn't seem to work
	though. I don't get what's going wrong.

	XCreateSimpleWindow so we get override redirect offscreen windows.

2002-06-08  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

2002-06-08  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_struts): only invalidate things if the
	struts actually change, since the panel likes to set them over and
	over. May fix the infinite loop that caused 100% CPU usage.

2002-06-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): use XineramaIsActive() not
	XineramaQueryExtension()

	Xinerama head, not the whole screen
	(meta_window_get_work_area): autocreate struts at the Xinerama
	physical screen edges for the screen the window is on.

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_get_xinerama_for_window): someone
	snuck in a for loop, fix it. ;-)

2002-06-06  James M. Cape <jcape@ignore-your.tv>

	* src/themes/Esco/metacity-theme-1.xml: Increase the border size
	of the buttons so they aren't quite so huge on my box. Also get
	a *little* closer to finally fixing the horizontal line behind
	the icon. It now works decently with common font sizes (in pixels).

	allow these windows to be focused (so keynav works), but they
	don't get focused automatically. Now how do we keep them out of
	the task list?

	* src/theme.c (draw_op_as_pixbuf): Use icon's instead of image's

	aspect ratios.

	* src/theme.h (struct _MetaFrameLayout): allow button sizes to be

	sizing parameters

	* src/theme.c (meta_frame_layout_calc_geometry): use new button
	layout params

	(shutdown_cancelled_callback): send SmcSaveYourselfDone when we

	META_PRIORITY_WORK_AREA_HINT): define some idle priorities

	their parent window is minimized
	(meta_window_minimize): also queue_calc_showing on all 
	transients of the window being minimized

	* src/place.c (constrain_placement): function to apply
	placement-time-only constraints, such as "not off the left of the
	screen"
	(meta_window_place): put dialogs down a bit over their parent, 
	not right at the top.
	(meta_window_place): when centering a dialog, center it 
	on the current xinerama screen, rather than the entire 
	screen.

	but not implemented

	portion of the region that's outside the screen.

2002-05-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_init): disable automatic GTK double
	buffering, since it resulted in gigantic backing pixmaps the size
	of the whole screen.
	(meta_frames_paint_to_drawable): change to take a region argument;
	punch the client area out of the expose region, then iterate over
	rectangles in the region and draw each, manually doing 
	begin_paint_rect. Results in 4 long thin backing pixmaps 
	per frame repaint, instead of one large backing pixmap. 
	Suggested by Owen.

2002-05-05  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* src/workspace.c: (meta_workspace_get_neighbor):
	Wrap-around workspaces (ie. when on the last workspace,
	"switch_to_workspace_right" goes back to the
	first one)

2002-05-05  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* src/metacity.schemas: Fix a spelling error and change 
	switch_to_workspace_up and switch_to_workspace_down to use
	Ctrl+Alt since Nautilus uses Alt now.

2002-05-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_net_wm_type): correctly print things if the
	type_atom is unset

2002-05-02  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* src/metacity.schemas: change the default for switch_to_workspace_*
	to be <Control><Alt>arrow as just <Alt>arrow collides with some apps
	(especially web browsers)

2002-05-01  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): Xlib doesn't like NULL for out
	arguments; fix for #80472 from lbedford

2002-04-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/keybindings.c: finish mopping up mode_switch_mask field

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): remove mode_switch_mask

	toolbars.

	* src/tools/metacity-window-demo.c: add menu and toolbar tests

	* src/place.c (meta_window_place): only dialogs should be centered
	over parent, not anything with transient for set.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): become more
	fascist about window positioning if workarounds are disabled, and
	less fascist if they are enabled.

	* src/metacity.schemas: add a "disable_workarounds" option.  Kind
	of crack-smoking. But we just can't get all applications
	fixed. And I need no-workarounds mode to monitor which apps are
	broken and what needs fixing in specs.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): always allow 
	windows to resize themselves

	* src/keybindings.c (reload_modmap): don't filter out Mode_switch,
	apparently some people bind window manager shortcuts to that.

2002-04-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (constrain_position): oops, fix
	maximization. Pointed out by Gustavo GirÃï¿½¡ldez

	mnemonic for consistency's sake.

2002-04-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (TITLEBAR_LENGTH_ONSCREEN): require 36 pixels
	onscreen so you typically get a sliver of titlebar, suggested by
	tigert.  Should still fix this to consider actual theme geometry.
	(constrain_position): change to allow movement off the left

2002-04-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): always raise windows on focus
	click, regardless of focus mode.

2002-04-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: 2.3.144

2002-04-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	does it yet though.
	
2002-04-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* README: remove caveats about keybindings

	* src/metacity.schemas: add schemas for all the keybindings.
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_activate): if in "show desktop" mode 
	when a window is activated, leave show desktop mode. So e.g. 
	when you click on a task in the task list, show desktop mode 
	will be turned off.

	that doesn't quite work yet (needs support for getting

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_parse_accelerator): new function

	* metacity.spec: fix to install gconf schemas

2002-04-25  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* src/session.c (load_state): g_file_get_contents() takes a gsize
	not int (fixes bus error on 64-bit platforms)

2002-04-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (main): call setlocale ourselves because due to a
	GLib bug that sticks us in ASCII if you call g_print or anything
	prior to setlocale, and print a warning if we don't set the locale
	successfully. #79280

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_get_work_area): be more verbose
	about how the work area was computed, to help find bugs here.

	* src/main.c (main): put locale and codeset in the log file

2002-04-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_send_icccm_message): add error trap,
	fixes a possible BadWindow if a window closed itself in response
	to the delete window message prior to us sending the ping message.

2002-04-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_move_resize_now): never revert to
	user_rect.width, user_rect.height. Maybe fixes assorted resize
	screwups e.g. with gnome-terminal.

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): query Xinerama screen
	information if HAVE_XINERAMA

	Use metacity-window-demo to test by clicking the 
	toolbar button that locks it up.

2002-04-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/tools/metacity-window-demo.c (do_appwindow): make one of the
	toolbar buttons lock up the demo

	* src/window.c (meta_window_delete): move error trap to be around
	a narrower part of the function, and add part of the ping stuff, 
	nothing user-visible yet

	* src/metacity-dialog.c (main): metacity-dialog executable to 
	live in libexecdir and pop up dialogs for us.

2002-04-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/theme.c (multiply_alpha): fix alpha multiplication routine
	to perhaps work correctly, reported by tigert. Also, be sure 
	we always copy the image if necessary before modifying the 
	alpha channel.

2002-04-05  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c: remove the unused tab stuff

	* src/display.c: implement tab list among panels

	translated.

2002-03-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): remove 
	unmanaged windows from save set, and unselect 
	input so we don't get events from them. Fixes annoying 
	bug where withdrawn windows would decide to map themselves
	due to save set stuff.

2002-03-22  Zbigniew Chyla  <cyba@gnome.pl>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added pl (Polish).

2002-03-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/themes/Bright/metacity-theme-1.xml: Added "Bright" theme
	from Gaute Lindkvist, with some small clipping tweaks to keep 
	text/icons from overlapping their frames.

2002-03-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/resizepopup.c (place_vertical_size_window) 
	(place_horizontal_size_window): disable the little shaped windows
	with the window size, they caused a crash anytime you tried to
	resize with Xft. And they were kind of on crack anyway.

2002-03-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/resizepopup.c (ensure_tick_windows): turn off the tick
	marks, that got annoying after about 5 minutes. One big shape 
	window instead of lots of little windows might fix it.

2002-03-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/resizepopup.c: Add some total crackrock resize-grid 
	indication for windows that have width_inc/height_inc
	so I can debug gnome-terminal sizing.

2002-03-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (set_clone_restart_commands): use proper property
	name for SmDiscardCommand (instead of setting the clone command to
	"rm"). Also fix typo that iterated over clonev not discardv to
	fill in prop list, and NULL-terminate discardv. #74584 from Kang
	Jeong-Hee.

2002-03-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/main.c (main): put back --sm-client-id argument, needed
	for including us in a default session

2002-03-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (meta_session_init): don't save a file here, only
	in response to SaveYourself. Change the code to properly use a
	unique state file for each SaveYourself. Totally, totally
	untested.

2002-03-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/theme-viewer.c: improve the theme viewer so people 
	can see the broken aspects of their themes.

2002-03-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/keybindings.c: use new functions

	MRU list instead of map order

	* src/window.c (meta_window_notify_focus): maintain focus MRU list

	* src/display.h (struct _MetaDisplay): Keep an MRU list of 
	windows.

2002-03-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	configure requests

2002-03-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): we didn't claim to support 
	_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW so gtk_window_present() didn't work. Mumble.
	Only worked with tasklist because libwnck didn't check for 
	WM support.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_free): clean off window state 
	when windows are withdrawn, to avoid sticking dialogs 
	to their initial desktop.
	(meta_window_queue_calc_showing): return if window is withdrawn

2002-03-08  Laszlo Peter  <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* configure.in: fix the X linker flags

2002-03-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/core.c (meta_core_get_grab_frame): add some assertions

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): make another warning 
	into a verbose

	* src/display.c (meta_change_button_grab): use verbose rather than
	warning to log failures to grab button, since these are typically
	BadWindow from a destroyed window.

2002-03-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_manage_window): use hash_table_replace
	instead of g_hash_table_insert

	successfully cleared the grab window

2002-03-05  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Work on opaque animations more, still suck too much 
	to turn on. Not sure how to make them good.
	
	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): 
	add a slide-up mode for shading

	* src/ui.c (meta_image_window_set): change image window to work by
	setting back pixmap on the GtkWindow, instead of using GtkImage.

2002-03-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/main.c (main): try ignoring SIGXFSZ, though I'm not 
	sure what that does exactly. I'm hoping it gives me EFBIG.

	* src/util.c (ensure_logfile): log to a file in /tmp instead 
	of to ~/metacity.log.

2002-03-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): disable resize etc. if
	we're fullscreen
	(constrain_size): fix size constraints when fullscreen

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): fix missing comma that
	ended up concatenating two of the properties breaking 
	FULLSCREEN state and PING protocol

2002-03-02  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c: Add hacking to fix the problem that we made our
	XGrabPointer() during Alt+Tab actually succeed, so on popping down
	Alt+Tab we got an EnterNotify from the ungrab, which resulted in
	focusing the window under the mouse. i.e. Alt+Tab didn't work with
	sloppy focus.

2002-02-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Screw around with Anders's ping patch so he'll get plenty of CVS
	conflicts. ;-)
	
	* src/display.c (meta_display_ping_window): spew warnings
	if we try to call this with CurrentTime
	(meta_display_ping_timeout): remove ping from the pending pings
	after it times out.

	* src/util.h: added PING debug category

	* src/display.c (remove_pending_pings_for_window): don't remove
	"tmp" just before "tmp->next", don't break out of loop after
	finding the first match
	(meta_display_open): no trailing comma in array init
	(event_callback): move the processing of ping replies into a
	separate function

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): add _NET_WM_PING to supported

	(meta_display_window_has_pending_pings):
	Implement meta_display_ping_window, and filter out scroll wheel 
	events.
	
	* src/display.h:
	Add MetaWindowPingFunc, meta_display_ping_window and
	meta_display_window_has_pending_pings.
	
2002-02-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (xcursor_for_op): switch on the op passed in, not
	the active op. Gives us the right cursor during resizing, etc.

	* src/errors.c: rearrange all the error stuff to adapt to the GDK
	change a while back, so now we print our X errors again
	
	* src/display.c (meta_display_begin_grab_op): remove KeyPressMask
	and KeyReleaseMask from the XGrabPointer(), this caused BadValue
	and kept the grab from ever succeeding. Fixes the problem with the 
	GTK resize grip - this is why you shouldn't break your X error 
	spew. ;-)

	* src/display.c: debug spew tweaks

	* src/window.c (meta_window_client_message): do some
	s/verbose/topic/ stuff

2002-02-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_init): put in hack to keep Pango from mangling
	our server grab and locking up on startup. (hack doesn't work 
	but I want to fix it on my real computer not this laptop)

	* src/window.c: Implement _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): add atoms for 
	_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
	
2002-02-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/main.c: Use bind_textdomain_codeset etc.
	
2002-02-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/theme-viewer.c: use the preview widget here

	* src/preview-widget.h, src/preview-widget.c: make the theme 
	preview into a nice widget

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_ensure_layout): replace frame layout
	if the frame style changes, this only ends up mattering if you
	e.g. changed the font size for windows in a different state such
	as maximized, which is crack, but the code may as well be correct

	* src/theme.c (meta_theme_get_frame_style): new function so we can 
	detect an invalid cache of the PangoLayout in a frame

2002-02-14  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* src/themes/Crux/metacity-theme-1.xml: Fix some bugs with

	* src/window.c (update_mwm_hints): and MWM_FUNC_ALL

	draw op to lose some of the PNG files in Gorilla theme

	* src/theme-parser.c: parse the tile primitive
	
2002-02-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_icon): port to icon cache

	* src/iconcache.c, src/iconcache.c: begin process of cleaning up
	window.c by moving the icon-reading code in here, based on the
	code in libwnck, which was in turn based on the earlier metacity
	code

2002-02-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_sync_to_server): hmm, and don't set
	last_window at all if we don't ++newp. Fixes even more obscure
	stacking bug.

2002-02-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_sync_to_server): assign last_window
	prior to ++newp, so we don't try to stack windows with respect to

        Rework the click-client-area-to-focus support to use synchronous

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_foreach_window): fix broken 
	"tmp = tmp->data"

	Implement do-not-pass-thru-click for click-to-focus mode.
	
	* src/screen.c (update_focus_mode): when focus mode changes,
	update all the window grabs

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_unfocused_window_buttons):
	implement grabbing button 1 on client area of unfocused
	click-to-focus windows

	* src/window.c (meta_window_update_unfocused_button_grabs): update
	whether we're grabbing unmodified button 1 on client area
	according to focus state and focus mode
	(meta_window_new): start out with proper grab state
	
2001-12-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): don't do mnemonics for
	workspaces above 9

2001-12-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): oops, remove extra workspace
	creation, and update to current pref.
	
2001-12-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_free): update number of
	workspaces hint

	* src/screen.c (update_num_workspaces): implement number of
	workspaces setting

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): honor configure
	requests on windows of type NORMAL, but still be mean to those of
	type DIALOG

	* src/main.c (main): add more log domains to those we set a log
	handler for, and only set warnings fatal in debug mode

	* src/metacity.schemas: add number of workspaces setting

2001-12-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): in click-to-focus mode don't
	focus on enter notify. Implement unfocusing on LeaveNotify in
	mouse focus mode. Click to focus just ends up working if we 
	do nothing on enter/leave, because of the way things already
	worked. Except I need to add some relatively complex hack to 
	allow clicking on client area, right now you have to click 
	on the frame.

2001-12-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/main.c (main): move SM init a bit later in the process, and 
	init prefs

	* src/session.c: fix no SM case (though I hardly know why I'm
	bothering)

	* src/main.c (main): call bindtextdomain

	* src/util.h (_): actually call gettext

	* configure.in: put in AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT and gconf stuff

	* src/prefs.c: Preferences - this marks the beginning of our doom.
	None of them are actually implemented yet, but we monitor 
	some stuff from gconf.
	
2001-12-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_unminimize): when unminimizing an app,
	if we're in "show desktop" (all windows minimized) mode, leave
	show desktop mode. Will occasionally be a bit weird, but allows
	people to recover via task list if they accidentally do the show
	desktop thing, and don't know what's going on.

2001-12-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_text_property_to_utf8): fix gdkatom/xatom screwup
	- gee, I should read my warnings

2001-12-03  Laszlo Peter  <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* src/frames.c: add a dummy element to the enum so
          the signals array is not empty. (breaks the build with Forte C)

	* src/window.c: s/__FUNCTION__/G_GNUC_FUNCTION/

2001-11-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (constrain_position): change so that window can be
	offscreen to the bottom or the right, as long as a small top-left 
	corner of the window remains onscreen. However, windows still
	can't go off the left or top.

2001-11-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (window_query_root_pointer): add error trap

2001-11-27  Jesus Bravo Alvarez  <jba@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Added gl (Galician) to ALL_LINGUAS.

Tue Nov 20 18:49:16 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* configure.in (found_sm): Add some additional quoting to
	make it work with autoconf-2.5x.

2001-11-02  Laszlo Peter  <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* src/window.c (update_sm_hints): protect meta_verbose from
	a NULL pointer.

2001-10-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: bump version

2001-10-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (idle_calc_showing): handle queue/unqueue of 
	calc showings as we are iterating over the pending list
	(meta_window_show): focus placed transients in here instead
	of in meta_window_place - now it should actually work, yay

	* src/place.c (meta_window_place): remove focusing of transient
	child from here; this was really broken

2001-10-29  Yuriy Syrota <rasta@renome.rovno.ua>

	* configure.in: Added "uk" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2001-10-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* README: note exciting new unminimize feature for the tab popup

	* src/keybindings.c (process_tab_grab): use meta_window_activate()
	when choosing a window with tab popup, this should deiconify it

	* src/window.c (meta_window_client_message): use
	meta_window_activate for _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message
	(meta_window_activate): new function to raise/focus/unminimize
	(meta_window_flush_calc_showing): new function
	(meta_window_focus): force a calc showing on focus, so that we can
	focus the window if appropriate (it must be mapped)

2001-10-26  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_window_buttons): fix for 
	ignoring NumLock on Alt-windowclick (previous NumLock fix 
	was only for key grabs not button grabs)

2001-10-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): set the current workspace hint

2001-10-25  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_visible_on_workspace):
	I was using meta_workspace_contains_window() in a number of 
	places where on_all_workspaces should also have been considered,
	thus this new function. Fixes bugs such as pinned windows 
	not appearing in the tab order.
	(meta_window_client_message): use meta_window_visible_on_workspace

	* src/stack.c (find_tab_forward): ditto
	(find_tab_backward): ditto
	(meta_stack_get_tab_next): ditto
	(meta_stack_get_tab_list): ditto

	* src/place.c (get_windows_on_same_workspace): ditto

	* src/keybindings.c (handle_focus_previous): ditto
	(handle_focus_previous): ditto

2001-10-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_expose_event): use bg/fg not base/text
	for the window title area.

2001-10-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): support initial
	on-all-workspaces setting

2001-10-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_sync_to_server): fix to keep desktop
	window from appearing on top of everything else, among other stack
	bugs. Untested.

2001-10-15  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): use queried attributes to check
	whether window should be initially maximized, rather than window 
	rect

2001-10-15  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/main.c (meta_restart): add a restart feature, for debugging

	* src/tools/metacity-restart.c: little utility program to trigger
	the restart

2001-10-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_button_press_event): raise/focus
	windows on left-click, seem to have broken that yesterday

	* src/keybindings.c, src/display.c, src/window.c: add keybinding
	to show/hide all normal windows (so you can see the desktop). 
	Currently Ctrl+Alt+D, which I don't like, but yay.

2001-10-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new): take a window mapped at
	fullscreen size/pos to desire maximization; once I add a
	fullscreen state, will change to copy kwin and take this mapping
	as a desire for fullscreen, but for now testing with maximization.

	* src/window.h: remove fullscreen window type, now proposing it 
	as a window state instead.	

2001-10-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_maximize): always raise windows on
	maximize
	(meta_window_client_message): when activating a window, move 
	it to current workspace, instead of moving user to the 
	window's workspace.

2001-10-14  HÃï¿½©ctor GarcÃï¿½­a Ãï¿½Âlvarez <hector@scouts-es.org>

	* configure.in: Added "es" to ALL_LINGUAS for Spanish translation.

2001-10-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): only handle events here if 
	the modmask from our button grab is active. i.e. only the
	Alt-click is handled here.

	* src/frames.c: add check for whether button presses are in the
	frame client area before handling them, so we don't weirdly let
	you move a frame by clicking in its client area if the client
	hasn't selected button press events.

2001-10-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_sync_to_server): set last window before 
	setting newp, so we don't get the current window as the last
	window and screw everything up	
	(IN_TAB_CHAIN): use type not layer to decide if a window is 
	in the tab chain, keeps panel out of alt-tab choices

2001-10-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: add bad hack to work with GTK 1.3.9.90 RPMs from
	gnomehide for now

	* src/ui.c: another piece of bad hack in here

2001-10-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: bump version

2001-10-13  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (meta_session_init): hmm, fix build

2001-10-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (meta_session_init): set the session manager
	priority so we start up before other apps.

2001-10-12  Mikael Hallendal  <micke@codefactory.se>

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_get_default_window_icon): use
	gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline
	(meta_ui_get_default_mini_icon): use
	gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline

2001-10-11  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "sv" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2001-10-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_free): fix mem leak of the MetaStack
	object
	(meta_stack_sync_to_server): try to avoid the restack-flicker
	thing

2001-10-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_update_active_window_hint): 
	set _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW hint
	
	* src/window.c (meta_window_client_message): support
	_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message

2001-10-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_client_message): don't allow
	shade/maximize/minimize for windows that don't support those
	operations. (minimizing the panel = bad)

2001-10-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/keybindings.c (meta_change_keygrab): add code to grab all
	modifier combinations, so keybindings work with NumLock etc.

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): remove newlines from menu
	items

2001-09-27  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (save_state): when encoding text for session file, 
	escape XML entities

2001-09-21  Alex Graveley  <alex@ximian.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (metacity_SOURCES): Add inlinepixbufs.h so
	that it gets generated.

	* src/frames.c (meta_frames_style_set): Update for new opaque
	PangoFontMetrics.

2001-09-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_init): add hackaround for the warning about
	gtk-menu-bar-accel

2001-09-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_get_default_mini_icon): 
	(meta_ui_get_default_window_icon): ref the returned icon, oops.

	* src/main.c (main): get the GLib warning/error output into 
	the metacity logfile, set warnings to be always fatal

	* configure.in: bump version to 2.3.13

	* src/window.c (get_text_property): hrm, fix bug where we didn't
	check errors on XGetTextProperty

2001-09-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (VARIABLES): fix srcdir != builddir glitch

2001-09-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c: use the inline image data for default icon
	
	* src/common.h (META_MINI_ICON_HEIGHT): move icon size defines
	here

	* src/Makefile.am: Create an inlinepixbufs.h header with inline
	images

2001-09-16  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/session.c (process_ice_messages): disconnect this callback
	on error

2001-09-16  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_lower): new function

	* configure.in: bump version to 2.3.8

	* src/display.c (event_callback): raise dock on enter notify, 
	lower it on leave notify (need to refine this behavior)

	* src/stack.c (compute_layer): experiment with putting the panel
	in the normal layer, and raising it on mouseover

2001-09-15  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c: add support for a mini icon in the titlebar
	(update_icon): re-enable support for _NET_WM_ICON

	* src/session.c (save_state): add an ferror check when writing
	session file

2001-09-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/main.c (usage): exit with error code on usage() (kind of
	wrong for --help, but oh well).

2001-09-11  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c: fix up handling of text properties, so we 
	get UTF8_STRING as that type and not as text list, and so 
	we properly convert from text list to UTF-8

2001-09-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/menu.c (meta_window_menu_new): icon for unmaximize

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_init): fix call to XDisplayName

	* src/util.c: add missing header

	* src/frames.c: draw an unmaximize control if already maximized

2001-09-10  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c: Don't separate user_has_moved/user_has_resized,
	fixes bug in east-resizing Emacs, among other things

	* src/frame.c (meta_frame_sync_to_window): return immediately if
	nothing to do

	* src/util.c (ensure_logfile): replace rather than truncate old
	logfiles

2001-09-08  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_ui_init): don't use gdk_display_name

	* src/frame.c (meta_window_ensure_frame): create frame
	with screen default visual, rather than client window visual;
	for DRI games, the client window visual was not allowed to be 
	a child of another window with the same visual, apparently.
	Anyhow now we copy twm, etc. so it must be correct.
	
	* src/place.c (meta_window_place): if a transient is placed and
	its parent has focus, focus the transient.

2001-09-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: bump version 2.3.5, require newer GTK release

2001-09-04  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/wm-tester/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): make test apps
	noinst

	* src/metacity.desktop: for the capplet

	* src/Makefile.am: add .desktop file

2001-09-01  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/errors.c: clean up the code, and replace GDK X error handler
	with one that chains up to GDK but first logs the error to logfile.

2001-08-31  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c (meta_ui_tab_popup_new): fix args to
	gtk_alignment_new()

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (event_callback): avoid focusing a window on tab
	popup popdown

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_ensure_tab_popup): compute frame
	outline size here

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: Switch back to outline.

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: experiment with window-cover-with-icon
	instead of just the outline; can't decide.

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: add crackrock window-outlining feature

	* src/session.c (window_type_to_string): handle fullscreen

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): wrong atom name -
	_NET_SUPPORTED not _NET_WM_SUPPORTED

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): geez, why were we
	honoring configure requests for width/height for normal windows. 
	Denied!
	(meta_window_client_message): _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE support, sort of
	(doesn't quite work, acts like owner_events = true?)

	* src/display.c: add _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE atom

2001-08-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Unbreak tab popup a bit.
	
	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_get_tab_list): add workspace argument
	(meta_stack_get_tab_next): add workspace argument

	* src/window.c: implement recording of the last user-initiated
	window position, so we can magically handle moving panels around
	really nicely.

	* src/wm-tester/main.c (set_up_icon_windows): fix to use new GTK
	API

2001-08-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (constrain_position): force fullscreen windows to
	be at 0,0

	* src/ui.c: use NULL colormap to get bitmaps, requires 
	very latest GTK from CVS or it will spew warnings
	and not work.
	
	* src/window.c (constrain_size): disallow larger than screen in
	all cases, even if user has performed a resize operation.
	(constrain_position): keep window boxed onscreen.

	* src/keybindings.c (meta_display_process_key_event): revert an
	earlier change that disabled global keybindings when a grab is in
	effect; instead, only disable global keybindings if a _keyboard_
	grab is in effect. The earlier change was just a broken
	workaround, the problems it fixed should have been solved by the
	addition of XGrabKeyboard() on the metacity keyboard grabs.

	This should fix the problem with
	pick-up-window-and-move-to-another-desktop.

2001-08-23  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_icon): attempt to use the mask as well as
	the pixmap. Probably doesn't work so well.

	* src/tabpopup.c: make this look a little nicer

2001-08-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_mwm_hints): all the MWM flag tests were
	backward

2001-08-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_icon): half-ass implementation of 
	getting pixmap icons (WM_NORMAL_HINTS and KWM_WIN_ICON). 
	Ignores mask for now, with possibly ugly results for 
	some apps.
	(read_rgb_icon): fixage

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c: add a "fullscreen" semantic type; if a window
	requests the screen size exactly, and is undecorated, and is not a
	desktop window, we consider it a fullscreen window and keep it on
	top.

	Totally untested.

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): we support _NET_WM_ICON

	* src/wm-tester/main.c: add stuff to test _NET_WM_ICON
	(but it doesn't work, so it isn't tested yet)
	
	* src/window.c (update_icon): read _NET_WM_ICON

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): set the WM_ICON_SIZE hint

	* src/tabpopup.c (meta_ui_tab_popup_select): remove assertion

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_icon_geometry): fix obscure
	memleak

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_window_buttons): remove XSync,
	error traps already do that
	(meta_display_grab_window_buttons): implement

	* src/keybindings.c: 
	src/display.c: wire up the tab window, it rulez!

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: add prototype thingy to display windows we're
	cycling through with tab. Not wired up to keybindings yet.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): put an XFlush()
	right after starting things moving

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): 
	(meta_window_move_resize_internal): Make a half-hearted
	not-very-tested attempt to handle window resizes correctly with
	respect to window gravity.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_gravity_position): hrm, I fixed
	this wrong the other day. Fixes static gravity when moving
	windows.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_image_window_set_position): also set the current
	size. Lame hack of the day.

	* src/effects.c (effects_draw_box_animation_timeout): use the
	delay exposes feature to avoid the screen dirt

	* src/ui.c
	(meta_ui_push_delay_exposes):
	(meta_ui_pop_delay_exposes): feature to let us delay redraws until
	after we do server-grabbed draw-on-inferiors effects

2001-08-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_gravity_position): fix for
	StaticGravity

2001-08-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): Honor USPosition
	even post-map. I know I'll regret this.

2001-08-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): set _NET_WM_NAME 
	hint as a UTF8_STRING not STRING. Patch from Anders.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/effects.c: disable opaque animations by default, current 
	implementation suXors.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): Get start
	time after we do the pixbuf from drawable, so we don't count
	time spent getting pixbuf from drawable in the animation time.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c: add opaque minimize/shade feature.  The wireframe
	seemed kind of confusing and unclear from a UI standpoint. 
	I know, I know. The bloat begins here.

	Also, we don't need to grab the server during opaque min/shade, 
	which has some nice implications.
	
	* src/ui.c: Add features to render a window with an image in it, 
	and also wrap pixbuf_from_drawable

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): 
	modify to be smoother (at least theoretically) by
