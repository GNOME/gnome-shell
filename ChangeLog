	Bug 1269 - mingw32 building failed at clutter-media.c

	* clutter/clutter-media.c: Rename the 'ERROR' signal enum to
	'ERROR_SIGNAL' otherwise it clashes with windgi.h. Thanks to David
	Kedves

2008-11-21  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/pango/cogl-pango.h: Include pango/pango.h to get
	pango-renderer.h. In versions prior to 1.18.4 pangocairo.h does
	not include pango-renderer.h

2008-11-21  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1280 - clutter_score_append_at_marker lead to segmentation
	fault in trunk and incorrect appearance in clutter-0.8

	* clutter/clutter-score.c (start_children_entries): Check whether
	the child timeline is actually attached at a marker before
	comparing whether the marker's name matches the marker
	reached. This fixes a crash that happens when a marker is reached
	on a timeline that also has child timelines attached at the
	end. Thanks to zhangwei for spotting.

2008-11-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_set_property): Add sanity checks for NULL
	boxed values when setting the rotation center.

	* tests/interactive/test-animation.c:
	(on_button_press): Add an example on how to use the rotation
	properties to animate an actor.

2008-11-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Fixed some trivial compiler warnings

	* tests/interactive/test-pixmap.c (create_pixmap): Use a format
	string instead of passing the error message directly to g_error.

	* tests/interactive/test-easing.c (test_easing_main)
	(on_button_press):
	* tests/interactive/test-animation.c (on_button_press): Use
	unsigned variables for the results from clutter_actor_get_size
	otherwise it complains about the pointer signedness being
	different.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c (clutter_script_add_search_paths): Use
	G_GSIZE_FORMAT instead of %d for a gsize parameter otherwise it
	gets upset on 64-bit.

2008-11-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/test-timeline.c (test_timeline): Remove the delay
	idle handler after the test is finished, otherwise it will
	continue running during subsequent tests. This was breaking
	test_timeline_interpolate.

2008-11-18  Robert Bragg  <robert@linux.intel.com>
	
	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-mesh.c:
	Re-works validate_custom_attribute_name() so it doesn't access an
	un-initialised variable.

2008-11-18  Robert Bragg  <robert@linux.intel.com>

	A comparison of gl/cogl-texture.c and gles/cogl-texture.c, to reduce
	differences and improve maintainability.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-context.h:
	Adds a CoglTextureGLVertex typedef + texture_vertices and
	texture_vertices_size members to CoglContext for using vertex arrays
	like GLES does

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-context.c:
	Initializes texture_vertices + texture_vertices_size members

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-internal.h:
	Adds COGL_ENABLE_COLOR_ARRAY

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c:
	Add COGL_ENABLE_COLOR_ARRAY support to cogl_enable

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-context.h:
	Change the CoglTextureGLVertex to use GLfloat for the position
	and texture coord attributes and GLubyte for the color.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture-private.h:
	Adds a wrap_mode member like GL has.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	Improves the comparability of the files, such that the remaining
	differences, better reflect the fundamental differences needed
	between GL and GLES. Notably GL no longer uses glBegin/glEnd for
	submitting vertices, it uses vertex arrays like GLES and this gives
	a small but measurable fps improvement for test-text.

2008-11-18  Robert Bragg  <robert@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-internal.h
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-internal.h:
	Removes semicolon after the GE() macro since that breaks using it as a
	single statement.

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter.h: Add clutter-shader.h and
	clutter-shader-types.h to the global include.

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/cogl/cogl-shader.h: Add a function for setting an
	integer uniform, similar to cogl_program_uniform_1f().

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-program.c: Implement the GL version
	of cogl_program_uniform_1i().

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-program.c: Implement the GLES version
	of cogl_program_uniform_1i().

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	(clutter_texture_get_preferred_width): Fix the usage of the
	fixed point division macro.

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/test-conform-main.c (main): Do not run the
	conformance test suite if we are on X11 but we do not have
	a DISPLAY available. Some of the tests require a DISPLAY,
	and everything passes through a clutter_init() call which will
	fail anyway. If we are running make distcheck on an headless
	box we might as well just skip the conformance test suite
	without a meaningless error.

2008-11-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/test-mesh-contiguous.c:
	* tests/conform/test-mesh-interleved.c:
	* tests/conform/test-mesh-mutability.c: Remove the last bare
	g_print() from the conformance test suite.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Update the lookup table with the
	new animation modes; match "linear" to the ramp-inc alpha
	function.

	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Add new AnimationMode values.

	* tests/interactive/test-easing.c: Update the easing functions
	test.

2008-11-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/test-pick.c (test_pick): The final result message
	when --verbose is used was the wrong way around

2008-11-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/test-conform-main.c (main): Fixed a typo in the
	name of the path for test_realized.

2008-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1014 - Clutter Animation API Improvements

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h: Update the build

	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Add AnimationMode, an enumeration
	for easing functions.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.[ch]: Add the :mode property to
	control the function bound to an Alpha instance using an
	enumeration value. Also add six new alpha functions:

		- ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out
		- sine-in, sine-out, sine-in-out

	* clutter/clutter-deprecated.h: Deprecate the #defines for
	the alpha functions. They will be replaced by entries in the
	ClutterAnimationMode.

	* clutter/clutter-interval.[ch]: Add ClutterInterval, an
	object for defining, validating and computing an interval
	between two values.

	* clutter/clutter-animation.[ch]: Add ClutterAnimation, an
	object responsible for animation the properties of a single
	actor along an interval of values. ClutterAnimation memory
	management is automatic. A simple wrapper method for
	ClutterActor is provided:

		clutter_actor_animate()

	which will create, or update, an animation for the passed
	actor.

	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add a new 'animation' debug note.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Clean up the alpha functions
	whitelist, and add the new functions.

	* doc/reference/clutter/Makefile.am:
	* doc/reference/clutter/clutter-sections.txt: Update the
	API reference.

	* doc/reference/clutter/clutter-animation.xml: Renamed to
	doc/reference/clutter/clutter-animation-tutorial.xml to
	avoid clashes with the ClutterAnimation section.

	* doc/reference/clutter/clutter-docs.sgml: Renamed to
	doc/reference/clutter/clutter-docs.xml, as it was an XML
	file and not a SGML file.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/interactive/Makefile.am:
	* tests/interactive/test-animation.c:
	* tests/interactive/test-easing.c: Add two tests for the
	new simple animation API and the easing functions.

	* tests/interactive/test-actors.c:
	* tests/interactive/test-behave.c:
	* tests/interactive/test-depth.c:

	to the deprecations and new alpha API.

2008-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c:
	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c:
	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: Use the ParamSpecColor and GValue
	API for ClutterColor-based properties.

2008-11-14  Robert Bragg  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>
	
	* tests/interactive/Makefile.am
	* tests/interactive/test-pixmap.c:
	test-pixmap + test-devices accidentally got dropped from the makefiles
	when changing the unit test layout; this puts them back.

2008-11-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1265 - ClutterScore doesn't emit 'started' signal (Bastian
	Winkler)

	* clutter/clutter-score.c: Emit the ::started signal.

	* tests/interactive/test-score.c: Check the emission of the
	Score signals.

2008-11-13  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c:
	Initialise the 'tex' sampler uniform to 0. The GLSL spec
	specifically says that you must initialize sampler uniforms. This
	fixes texturing for GLES 2 when using the PowerVR simulator via
	software Mesa.

2008-11-13  Robert Bragg  <robert@linux.intel.com>

	Gets the mesh API working with GLES2

	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-mesh.c:
	Make sure we use the appropriate cogl_wrap_gl* funcs as appropriate

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	In our glColorPointer wrapper we needed to mark our color attribute
	as normalized.

	* tests/conform/Makefile.am:
	When creating unit test symlinks we use the -l gtester option to
	list tests, but when using the PVR SDK the test binary also spews
	out some extra info that caused lots of random symlinks to be
	created. We now grep for lines starting with a '/'

	* tests/conform/test-mesh-contiguous.c
	* tests/conform/test-mesh-mutability.c:
	Use cogl_set_source_color instead of directly calling glColor4ub

2008-11-13  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_get_paint_visibility):
	Fix logic so that it won't return TRUE for a hidden stage.

2008-11-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_applied): Do not reset the depth
	of the actors to which the Ellipse behaviour has been applied
	to, unless the behaviour is going to update it because it has
	a tilt on the X or Y axis.

2008-11-13  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_get_reactive)
	(clutter_actor_get_paint_visibility): Be sure to return exactly
	TRUE or FALSE instead of zero or some non-zero value in these
	functions that return a gboolean. Thanks to Kai Wei for spotting.

2008-11-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* tests/conform/Makefile.am:
	* tests/conform/test-conform-main.c:
	* tests/conform/test-paint-opacity.c: Add test unit for label,
	rectangle and paint opacity.

2008-11-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/cogl/cogl-color.h:
	* clutter/cogl/cogl-path.h:
	* clutter/cogl/cogl-types.h: 
	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-color.c: Deprecated cogl_color()
	in favour of cogl_set_source_color() and friends; store the
	CoglColor components as unsigned bytes instead of fixed point
	normalized values; add functions for allocating, copying and
	freeing CoglColor, for use of language bindings.

	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in:
	* clutter/cogl/cogl-deprecated.h: Added cogl-deprecated.h,
	an header file containing the deprecation symbols similar
	to clutter-deprecated.h.

	* clutter/pango/cogl-pango-render.c: Ditto as above.

	* doc/reference/clutter/subclassing-ClutterActor.xml:
	* doc/reference/cogl/cogl-sections.txt: Update the documentation.

2008-11-12  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1057 - cogl_texture_rectangle doesn't support backward
	coordinates

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c: Instead of sorting the vertex
	and texture coordinates passed to cogl_texture_rectangle, just
	swap both sets whenever the texture coordinates are backward.

2008-11-12  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c (clutter_rectangle_paint): Fixed so
	that it doesn't use the alpha value from the border colour to draw

2008-11-07  Robert Bragg  <robert@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1162 - Re-works the tests/ to use the glib-2.16 unit testing
	framework
	
	* configure.ac:
	* tests/*:
	The tests have been reorganised into different categories: conformance,
	interactive and micro benchmarks.
	- conformance tests can be run as part of automated tests
	- interactive tests are basically all the existing tests
	- micro benchmarks focus on a single performance metric
	
	I converted the timeline tests to conformance tests and also added some
	tests from Neil Roberts and Ebassi.
	
	Note: currently only the conformance tests use the glib test APIs,
	though the micro benchmarks should too.
	
	The other change is to make the unit tests link into monolithic binaries
	which makes the build time for unit tests considerably faster. To deal
	with the extra complexity this adds to debugging individual tests I
	have added some sugar to the makefiles so all the tests can be run
	directly via a symlink and when an individual test is run this way,
	then a note is printed to the terminal explaining exactly how that test
	may be debugged using GDB.

	There is a convenience make rule: 'make test-report', that will run all
	the conformance tests and hopefully even open the results in your web
	browser. It skips some of the slower timeline tests, but you can run
	those using 'make full-report'

	Bug 1238 - [PATCH] Pack bitfields in ClutterTexturePrivate

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: 

	Using 'guint my_field : 1' for booleans to save space only
	makes sense if you group all such fields together. Fix
	grouping for ClutterTexturePrivate. Thanks to Owen Taylor for
	patch.

	Bug 1230 - Pick fails on low precision color buffers

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (_clutter_id_to_color): When using fuzzy
	picking to pick a color for an actor, it would previously set the
	fuzzy bit and then all but the most significant of the remaining
	unused bits. This meant that for 16-bit displays it would end up
	with a strange pattern for the unused bits like 1011 which could
	cause it to round up. Now it just sets all but the most
	significant of all of the unused bits giving a pattern like
	0111. Thanks to Guy Zadickario for the patch.

	Bug 1181 - In Score, timelines, appended at markers, are also
	called on complete

	* clutter/clutter-score.c (start_children_entries): Use the name
	of the marker to start as the data parameter and only start child
	timelines that have the same marker name. Previously the
	ClutterScore would just start all child entries when a marker was
	reached or the timeline completed regardless of whether they were

2008-11-03  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1207 - Timelines sometime miss markers

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c (timeline_timeout_func): Move the
	code for firing the new-frame and marker-reached signals into a
	separate static function so that it can also be called when the
	last frame is reached. Also fix an issue where the frame numbers
	were changed in the wrong direction when detecting missed markers
	in a reversed timeline. Based on a patch by Michael Boccara.

	* tests/test-timeline.c: Now tries to automatically verify whether
	the test worked by keeping track of all the signal emissions. The

	automatically transform strings into colors and vice versa.

	(clutter_color_free): Allow NULL parameter to match other boxed

	* clutter/clutter-container.[ch]: Add checks to the Container
	interface invocation methods, to avoid crashing or corrupting
	the stack when an actor does not implement every virtual
	function of the Container interface vtable. GObject allows this
	to happen so we must handle the case gracefully. This also means
	that we can classify some virtual function as mandatory (as is
	the case for ::add, ::remove and ::foreach) and some other
	optional.

	much straightforward: stop a timeline, advance it, and retrieve
	the alpha value before starting the timeline to adjust an
	animation dependent on the alpha. Caching the alpha value is
	not needed because the behaviours will always pass the alpha
	value inside the ::alpha-notify virtual function anyway, so
	there is no need for them to call clutter_alpha_get_alpha().

	This change makes it also possible to reliably unit-test
	ClutterAlpha.

	(timeline_new_frame_cb): Call clutter_alpha_get_alpha().

	that the main loop can be restarted.

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:

	Bug 1033 - Manually parsing command line options prevents
	initializing clutter

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	(post_parse_hook), (clutter_init_with_args),
	(clutter_parse_args), (clutter_init): Move the initialization
	of Clutter at the end of the post-parse hook of Clutter's

	argument parsing.

2008-09-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@linux.intel.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Properly document the

	converts incorrectly on some hardware.

2008-09-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1080 - clutter_stage_read_pixels has upside-down y coordinate

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_read_pixels): Use
	OpenGL's coordinate system for the arguments to glReadPixels (so
	that y zero is the bottom of the window). Use clutter_redraw
	instead of clutter_stage_paint to ensure the right GL context is
	selected. Set some of the glPixelStore parameters that might have
	been changed by Cogl.

	* tests/test-stage-read-pixels.c: Replace with a different test
	that gets a sub-region of the stage around the cursor.

	Bug 1034 - Picking doesn't work on Eee PC

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (_clutter_id_to_color): When choosing a
	pick color, set all but the most significant of the unused
	bits. This should make make it more likely that the GL
	implementation will round down to the right value.

	* tests/test-pick.c: Test case for picking. It creates 192 actors
	at known positions and stores their gids. It then calls
	clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos with each position to check that
	the right gid is returned.

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Add test-pick

2008-09-12  Neil Roberts  <neil@linux.intel.com>

	Bug 1010 - ClutterLabel does not update the layout (again)

	* clutter/clutter-label.c: Bring back layout caching. This time it
	will cache up to three different layouts. The width for which each
	layout was generated is stored so that if the same width is
	requested again it can use the cached version. If no cached
	version is available it will try to replace the oldest
	layout. 'Age' is determined by a counter which is incremented
	every time a layout is created. The cache is cleared after any
	property changes that might affect the layout.
	(struct _ClutterLabelPrivate): Removed extents_width,
	extents_height and context because they weren't used anywhere.

	* tests/test-label-cache.c: Add a test which checks whether the
	label is using a different layout when properties are
	changed. Also compares the extents of the label's layout with an
	independent layout and fails if they aren't the same.

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Add test-label-cache

2008-09-10  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Bug 1137 - Setting the anchor point does not trigger a re-paint

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_set_property): When
	changing the anchor point properties, use set_anchor_pointu
	instead of changing the value directly so that a redraw will be
	queued.
	(clutter_actor_set_anchor_pointu): Queue a redraw when the anchor
	point is changed. Thanks to Johan Bilien.

	* clutter/clutter-container.c (create_child_meta): Instead of
	setting the members of the ChildMeta structure, use the

	projection matrix to render it as it would appear on screen.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: 
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c
	(_clutter_actor_apply_modelview_transform_recursive): No longer

	Bug 1071 - clutter_timeline_get_duration doesn't always work

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Calculate the 'duration' property
	on-demand instead of storing it as a member variable. Notify
	duration property changes whenever the fps or num_frames changes.

2008-08-01  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Bug 1069 - Warnings with ClutterScore

	* clutter/clutter-score.c (clutter_score_is_playing): Check
	whether priv->running_timelines is NULL before checking its
	length.
	(foreach_running_timeline): Remove the completed signal handler
	when stopping the score. Otherwise the completed callback will get
	called multiple times if the timeline is started later.

2008-07-31  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Bug 1075 - Difficult to bind clutter_stage_new

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_dispose): Unrealize the
	stage before removing the update idle handler. Otherwise
	unrealizing causes another redraw to be queued and if the stage
	object remains alive it will cause an assert and abort.

2008-07-30  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_class_init): Added the
	'perspective' property. All of the machinery was there to
	implement the property but somehow the call that actually installs
	it was missing.

2008-07-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h:
	* clutter/clutter-units.h: Fix the upper and lower boundaries of

	were not enough to describe those values.

2008-07-30  Ross Burton  <ross@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	Destroy the debugging timer when the context is freed.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	Free the stage title when the stage is finalized.

2008-07-30  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.c (clutter_model_set_sorting_column): This
	function is supposed to accept -1 to disable sorting. However it
	checks for whether the column is >= the number of columns, but
	clutter_model_get_n_columns() returns an unsigned int so the
	column number also gets promoted to unsigned for the
	comparison. Therefore -1 is always greater than the number of
	columns so it wouldn't let you set it.

2008-07-26  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c (clutter_timeline_list_markers): When
	requesting the list of markers it was returning the marker data as
	a string instead of the name so it was copying garbage.

2008-07-25  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_remove_clip)
	(clutter_actor_set_clipu): Queue a redraw when the clip is
	changed.

2008-07-24  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: 
	* clutter/clutter-group.c: 
	* clutter/clutter-entry.c: 
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c: Remove unnecessary calls to
	cogl_{push,pop}_matrix. The matrix is preserved in
	clutter_actor_paint whenever the actor's transformation is applied
	so there should be no need to push the matrix in actor paint
	implementations unless it does some additional transformations
	itself.

2008-07-16  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.pc.in: Add a variable containing the COGL backend

	flag inside the real initialization function.

2008-07-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c: Properly document the behaviour
	of the :alignment property.

2008-07-04  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* build/mingw/mingw-cross-compile.sh: Default to the win32 flavour

2008-07-04  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Bug 1015 - Cloning unparented actors with FBOs doesn't work with
	new layout code

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c (clutter_texture_new_from_actor): Now
	parents the source actor if it doesn't already have a parent so
	that it will get an allocation during layout.

	* tests/test-fbo.c: One of the tests tries to ensure that the
	ClutterTexture clone keeps the source actor alive by derefing
	it. However as actors have a floating reference then test-fbo
	doesn't have its own reference once the source is parented so
	unrefing just steals the parent's reference and causes
	badness. The test now claims the floating reference before cloning
	the source so that it can safely be unref'd later.

2008-07-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/Makefile.am: Fix distchecking by adding the
	generated enum types files to DISTCLEANFILES.

2008-07-03  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h:
	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c
	Fixed inlining of clutter_qmulx() and clutter_qdivx() (bug 1022).

2008-07-03  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-shader.c (bind_glsl_shader): Fix a cut-and-paste
	error which broke vertex shaders

2008-07-03  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-bitmap-pixbuf.c:
	(_cogl_bitmap_from_file): removed debug g_printf that announces each
	successful image load done by the internal image backend.

2008-07-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c
	(clutter_actor_get_abs_allocation_vertices): The initialization of
	the local stage pointer got moved away in revision 3081 so it was
	crashing if the function is called before the layout is run.

2008-07-02  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	(clutter_label_create_layout_no_cache),
	(clutter_label_create_layout): Split the layout creation in two
	functions: one creating the layout, the other creating the layout
	and hitting the glyphs cache. The first one is for the offscren
	operations - like requesting the preferred size; the second one
	is for paint and allocation.

	(clutter_label_allocate): Try to aggressively cache the PangoLayout
	between allocations - to avoid recreating it even when the label
	just moved because of an animation. See bug #1010.

2008-07-02  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/fruity/clutter-fruity.c: made the multi touch code more
	robust. There are situations though where the device seems to stop
	generating any touch events until all fingers have been lifted and
	a new interaction session is started.

2008-07-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c (clutter_stage_egl_realize):
	Use clutter_x11_has_event_retrieval() instead of

	Bug 1010 - ClutterLabel does not update the layout (Lee Jusung)

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_queue_relayout): Remove some pointer dereferencing.

	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	(clutter_label_allocate): Revert the change of r2883 and remove the
	layout width cache and force a recreation of the layout every time
	we receive an allocation.

2008-07-01  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_get_transformed_sizeu):
	This is now do-what-I-mean like clutter_actor_get_size so that if
	the allocation box is available it will use that, otherwise it
	will use the preferred size. clutter_actor_transform_vertices has
	been converted to clutter_actor_transform_and_project_box so that
	it can be used by both functions. Based on a patch by Emmanuele
	Bassi.
	(clutter_actor_get_abs_allocation_vertices)
	(clutter_actor_get_allocation_vertices): These two functions now
	force a relayout if the allocation box is not available.

	* tests/test-fbo.c: Fixed the shader to use texture2D instead of
	texture2DRect now that GL_EXT_texture_rectangle is no longer used.

2008-07-01  Chris Lord  <chris@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	Add a note to the clutter_stage_read_pixels doc that the alpha channel

	* clutter/osx/clutter-event-osx.c (clutter_event_osx_translate,
	NSEvent:clutterStage:)
	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.c (EVENT_HANDLER): Since events are
	delivered to ClutterGLView, pass the associated ClutterStage directly
	to event translation. Avoids relying on being embedded in
	ClutterGLWindow, which makes it easier to implement clutter-gtk.

2008-06-29  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@iki.fi>

	* clutter/osx/clutter-event.osx.c (NSEvent:clutterKeyVal:): Add

	(clutter_actor_set_min_width),
	(clutter_actor_set_min_height),
	(clutter_actor_set_natural_width),
	(clutter_actor_set_natural_height): If setting the minimum
	and natural width and height on a top-level actor, and on
	a backend that provides only static stages, then override
	the value and use the size of the display as returned by
	the backend.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_realize): Remove the setting of the
	minimum and natural width and height.

2008-06-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:

	themselves.

2008-06-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:

2008-06-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-backend.h:
	* clutter/clutter-backend.c:
	(clutter_backend_get_display_size): Add a function for getting the
	display size out of the backend.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_allocate): When allocating on a backend with a
	static stage, we simply ignore the passed box and override it with
	the size of the display.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_get_display_size),
	(clutter_backend_egl_class_init): Implement get_display_size() by
	returning the size of the EGL surface.

	* clutter/fruity/clutter-backend-fruity.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_get_display_size),
	(clutter_backend_egl_class_init): Ditto as above.

2008-06-25  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c
	(clutter_stage_win32_realize): Use a more direct method to choose
	the best pixel format instead of ChoosePixelFormat because
	otherwise if the display's depth is 16 then it will prefer the
	non-accelerated software implementation when the requested depth
	is 24.

2008-06-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_allocate): Fix condition;

	and interrupt the allocation chain there.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_class_init): Remove the ::allocate empty
	stub.

2008-06-25  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

2008-06-25  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_paint): Guard against the
	actor clip being enabled or disabled in an actor paint

	Bug 989 - Add a search path for clutter script assets

	* clutter/clutter-script.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	(clutter_script_finalize),
	(clutter_script_add_search_paths),
	(clutter_script_lookup_filename): Add the ability to define multiple
	search paths inside ClutterScript and to look up a specific filename
	inside those search paths. This is useful to define a set of
	directories where the assets for a UI definition are and still
	reference those assets by their name instead of the full path. (989,
	based on a patch by Matthew Allum)

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	(clutter_texture_set_custom_property): Use the newly added
	clutter_script_lookup_filename() function.

2008-06-24  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c: All of the settings and
	uniforms are now proxied into COGL variables instead of setting
	the GL uniforms directly. Just before glDrawArrays is executed a
	shader is generated using the given settings to avoid using 'if'
	statements. The shaders are cached.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-vertex-shader.glsl:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl: The shaders
	are now split into parts using comments instead of 'if' statements
	so that the simplest shader can be generated on the fly.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/stringify.sh: Now splits up the shader sources
	into separate C strings where deliminated by special comments.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-program.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-program.c: A custom shader can no longer
	be directly linked with the fixed-functionality replacement
	because the replacement changes depending on the settings. Instead
	the bound shader is linked with the appropriate replacement shader
	just before glDrawArrays is executed. The custom uniform variables
	must also be proxied through COGL variables because their location
	can change when relinked.

2008-06-24  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/fruity/clutter-fruity.c: removed dead code and unused

2008-06-23  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c (clutter_entry_paint): Set the clip
	using COGL directly instead of setting the actor clip. Otherwise
	the clip stack will be unbalanced after the first draw. This also
	frees up the actor clip to be set by an application.

	preferred width maintaining the aspect ratio with the given height
	and a preferred height maintaining the aspect ratio with the
	given width. This allows to set the width or the height and have
	the texture automatically request the height or the width respectively
	while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original image.

	* tests/test-script.json: Update to test the new :keep-aspect-ratio
	property.

	Bug #815 - Split up request, allocation, and paint box

	* clutter/clutter-actor.[ch]: Rework the size allocation,
	request and paint area. Now ::request_coords() is called

	based on a patch by Havoc Pennington, Lucas Rocha and Johan

	fixed naming of implementation of cogl_path_rel_curve_to (it was
	called just cogl_rel_curve_to).

2008-06-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Clean up a bit the X11 and X extensions
	checks with PKG_CHECK_EXISTS(). Since we are filling up the
	X11_CFLAGS and X11_LIBS variables ourselves there is no
	point in polluting the Makefiles with unused variables.

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Remove the pkg-config variable
	evaluation and use the values retrieved from the configure
	script.

2008-06-09  Chris Lord  <chris@openedhand.com>

	Bug #914 - ClutterEntry is confused about characters vs. bytes

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c: (clutter_entry_ensure_layout),
	(clutter_entry_handle_key_event_internal),
	(clutter_entry_set_text):
	Fix mix-up of character and byte counts, handle unicode correctly.
	Use clutter_key_event_unicode() instead of
	clutter_keysym_to_unicode().

	* clutter/clutter-event.c: (clutter_key_event_unicode):
	Don't ignore ClutterKeyEvent.unicode_value

	* clutter/clutter-keysyms-table.h:
	Rename header define so as not to conflict with clutter-keysyms.h

	Patch originally by Emmanuele Bassi, with input from Tommi Komulainen.

2008-06-07  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: made the filter-quality proeprty also
	control the use of mipmapping.
	* clutter/clutter-texture.h: added ClutterTextureQuality enum.
	* tests/test-texture-quality.c: new test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: added test-texture-quality

2008-06-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	(clutter_texture_class_init): Do not unrealize on hide(), and
	do not realize() on show. By default, clutter_actor_show() will
	realize ourselves, and we don't want to unrealize when hidden
	to avoid paying the penalty of reading back the texture data
	from the video memory.

	* tests/test-actors.c: Show all textures again when pressing
	the 'r' key.

2008-06-06  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* tests/test-shader.c: Use the special wrapper vars when building
	for GLES 2 and automatically cycle the shaders because it's
	difficult to right-click.

2008-06-06  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* tests/test-shader.c: Fixed to use sampler2D instead of
	sampler2DRect now that GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE support is disabled in
	revision 2834. The ClutterTexture actor now has the
	'disable-slicing' property set. The distance in texture
	coordinates between pixels is passed in as a uniform so that the
	box-blur shader can still work.

2008-06-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #952 - Fix test-textures in trunk

	* tests/test-textures.c: Use USE_GDKPIXBUF instead of
	USE_PIXBUF. (#952, Gwenole Beauchesne)

2008-06-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #951 - Fix clutter_entry_init() in trunk

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c (clutter_entry_init): Remove a
	variable shadowing another one. (#951, Tommi Komulainen)

2008-06-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #955 - ClutterLabel is missing fallback resolution handling

	* clutter/clutter-label.c (clutter_label_init): Handle
	clutter_backend_get_resolution() return value -1 similar to
	ClutterEntry (falling back to 96.0). (#955, Tommi Komulainen)

2008-06-06  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c
	(clutter_stage_egl_realize): Use ES 2 renderable type when
	building for GLES 2.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-event-egl.c (get_backend_time): Added
	a NULL for the microseconds parameter of g_timer_elapsed.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.h:
	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-egl.h:
	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.h: Include
	clutter-egl-headers.h instead of including the GL headers directly
	so it can include gl2.h when building for GLES 2.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-egl-headers.h:
	* clutter/eglnative/Makefile.am (libclutter_eglnative_la_SOURCES):
	Added clutter-egl-headers.h

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl: GLES 2
	doesn't provide a default precision for floats in the fragment
	shader and it will reject the shader if there isn't one.

2008-06-06  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	Bug #948 - Remove texture rectangle support

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c:
	* clutter/clutter-feature.h:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.c:
	Remove support for GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB (now using just regular
	2D textures, with optional npots extension). Simplifys code, + makes
	mipmap & shader support much more sane.

2008-06-06  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	Bug #931 - suspicious size allocation for pixel data.

	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-bitmap-pixbuf.c:
	(_cogl_bitmap_from_file): allocate height×rowstride and not duplicate
	gdkpixbuf's strange optimization saving some bytes at the end of the
	pixbuf.

2008-06-05  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@iki.fi>

	Bug 913 - cogl fails to build on OSX

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-fbo.c: define GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT and
	GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT if not defined in the build system. The
	#ifdef can fail if they're not #defines but variables or enums.
	As the values are supposed to be industry standard even then
	it shouldn't have ill effects.

2008-06-05  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@iki.fi>

	Bug #911 - OSX: add multistage support

	* clutter/osx/clutter-backend-osx.{c,h}
	(clutter_backend_osx_init_stage, clutter_backend_osx_get_stage,
	clutter_backend_osx_redraw, clutter_backend_osx_create_stage,
	clutter_backend_osx_ensure_context, clutter_backend_osx_class_init,
	clutter_backend_osx_dispose, ClutterGLView:drawRect:):
	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.{c,h} (clutter_stage_osx_realize,
	ClutterGLWindow:setFrameSize:):
	Adapt to new multistage backend API. Don't keep a pointer to
	default stage. Derive from ClutterActor instead of ClutterStage.
	Implement ClutterStageWindow interface. Paint, resize and
	otherwise manipulate the wrapper rather than self when necessary.

	(clutter_backend_post_parse): Create our singleton GL context
	here. We could probably create the context when the default
	stage is created, but I think this is more clean.

	* clutter/osx/clutter-event-osx.c (clutter_event_osx_translate)
	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.c (clutter_stage_osx_state_update,
	ClutterGLWindow:windowShouldClose:):
	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.h: Export ClutterGLWindow interface
	for clutter-event-osx.c to easily get the stage for NSWindow.
	Fill in ClutterEventAny::stage on our events.

2008-06-05  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@iki.fi>

	Bug #910 - OSX: missing memory pool

	* clutter/osx/clutter-backend-osx.c (clutter_backend_osx_redraw):
	Add missing memory pool wrapup.

2008-06-05  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@iki.fi>

	Bug #909 - OSX: missing NULL pointer handling

	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.c (ClutterGLWindow,
	clutter_stage_osx_set_title): NSString:stringWithUTF8String:
	does not accept NULL values, use empty string ("") instead.
	Avoids potential crash.

2008-06-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-paint-wrapper.c: Add a test case (merely, a copy
	of test-actors.c) that verifies that handlers to the ::paint
	signal are called in the right order.

2008-06-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #840 - Implement prepare-paint and finish-paint signals.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_class_init): Add the ::paint, ::realize and
	::unrealize signals to ClutterActor. It is possible to
	override the paint, realization and unrealization of an
	actor without subclassing it. The ::paint signal handlers
	have the same limitations of a ClutterActor::paint implementation
	inside a subclass.

	(clutter_actor_realize),
	(clutter_actor_unrealize),
	(clutter_actor_paint): Emit the signals instead of calling
	the functions from the class vtable.

2008-06-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* ChangeLog-ivan: Remove the ChangeLog of the clutter-ivan
	branch; the branch already contains it.

2008-06-05  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.h:
	Actually export clutter_glx_texture_pixmap_using_extension ()

2008-06-05  Chris Lord  <chris@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c:
	Correct the documentation for clutter_entry_set_max_length, fixes bug
	#915.

2008-06-04  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* tests/test-clip.c:
	Removes a spurious #include <gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h> which may not
	be found if using --with-imagebackend=internal

2008-06-04  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* configure.ac:
	Checks that for pangocairo >= 1.18, since
	pangocairo-font.c uses pango_cairo_font_get_scaled_font which isn't
	otherwise available.

2008-06-03  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Applied patch from bug #947

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_get_default): Don't grab
	the floating reference when creating the default stage. The stage
	manager will take a reference to it so it will behave as any other
	stage.
	(clutter_stage_new): Don't take the floating reference to the new
	stage but let the stage manager keep it instead.

	* clutter/clutter-stage-manager.c
	(_clutter_stage_manager_add_stage): Take a reference to the stage
	when it is added to the list.
	(_clutter_stage_manager_remove_stage): Unref the stage when it is
	removed from the list.
	(clutter_stage_manager_dispose): Keep track of the 'next' pointer
	as a separate variable so we can cope when the stage being
	destroyed removes itself from the list as the list is being
	iterated.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_destroy): Take a
	reference at the beginning of the function even if there is no
	parent container so that overall the reference count is not
	changed when the actor is unref'd again at the bottom of the
	function. Previously it would have a net effect of leaving the
	reference count alone unless it is a top level actor in which case
	it would unref it.

2008-06-03  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.c:
	Dont always fallback to x11 (slow) updates for a single
	failed pixmap.
	Minor cleanups.
	* clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c:
	Move shm allocation to only area updates.

2008-06-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-glyph-cache.c
	(pango_clutter_glyph_cache_set): When creating a new band, make
	sure the texture is wide enough for the glyph, not just tall
	enough.

2008-06-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Applied 'final patch' from bug #874

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c: The clip planes are now set using the
	inverse projection matrix as the modelview matrix so that they can
	be specified in screen coordinates.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-context.h (CoglContext):
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-context.h (CoglContext): Added a member to
	cache the inverse projection matrix

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h: Added a constant for converting from
	radians to degrees.

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c (clutter_atani, clutter_atan2i): Added
	fixed-point versions of atan and atan2.

	* tests/test-clip.c: Added a test for clipping with various
	rotations and depths.

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Added test-clip

2008-06-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h: The uniform numbers are
	now stored in a separate struct so they can be stored for
	application program objects as well.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c: Moved stub shader functions into
	separate files.
	(_cogl_features_init): Report support for the shaders feature on
	GLES 2

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-shader.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-shader.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-program.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-program.c: Separate files to handle
	shaders on programs on GLES. If version 1.1 is being used then the
	stub functions which all fail are still used.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c
	(cogl_gles2_wrapper_init, cogl_gles2_wrapper_bind_attributes),
	(cogl_gles2_wrapper_get_uniforms): Move the uniforms and attribute
	bindings into a separate function so they can be used to bind on
	application shaders as well.
	(cogl_gles2_wrapper_update_matrix): Now takes a parameter and is
	no longer static so that it can be used to update all of the
	matrices when a new shader is bound.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-defines.h.in: Use GL_COMPILE_STATUS for
	CGL_OBJECT_COMPILE_STATUS if the latter isn't available (for
	example on GLES 2).

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-context.h (CoglContext): Added handle
	arrays for programs and shaders.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-context.c (cogl_create_context)
	(cogl_destroy_context): Initialize and destroy program and shader
	handle array.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/Makefile.am (libclutter_cogl_la_SOURCES): Add
	cogl-{shader,program}.{c,h}

2008-06-02  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-context.c (cogl_destroy_context): Fix
	cut-and-paste error where the wrong arrays were being freed.

2008-06-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Merge from clutter-0-6:

	* clutter/clutter-model.c:
	(clutter_model_iter_set_internal_valist): Add an internal function
	wrapping ClutterModelIter::set_value that does not emit the
	::row-changed signal. Emitting this signal before the ::row-added
	one is wrong: a row cannot change before being inserted.

	(clutter_model_append), (clutter_model_prepend),
	(clutter_model_insert): Use the non-signal emitting variant of
	clutter_model_iter_set_valist().

	(clutter_model_iter_set_valist): Use the internal version and emit
	the ::row-changed signal at the end.

2008-05-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #943 - Signals are only emitted within a certain area of
		   the stage

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_do_event): Use the proper
	API and not the macros for the default stage, in case we are
	using a backend supporting multiple stages. (Julian Aron Prenner)

2008-05-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	(cogl_gles2_wrapper_init): Get the uniforms for alpha testing
	settings.
	(cogl_wrap_glEnable, cogl_wrap_glDisable): Enable/disable alpha
	testing.
	(cogl_wrap_glAlphaFunc): Filled in the wrapper.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl: Added alpha
	testing.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c
	(cogl_wrap_glGetIntegerv): Added a wrapper for glGetIntegerv so
	that it can report zero clip planes.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c: Use the wrapped version of
	glGetIntegerv

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-primitives.c (_cogl_path_fill_nodes): Use
	_cogl_features_available to check for the stencil buffer instead
	of an #ifdef. The stencil buffer is available in the default
	profile for the GLES 2 simulator.

2008-05-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Check the --with switches as soon as we have them,
	to avoid further checks that will fail anyway.

2008-05-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* README: Update the configure arguments list.

2008-05-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c
	(cogl_gles2_wrapper_init): Get uniforms for fog parameters and
	initialise them.
	(cogl_wrap_glDrawArrays): Store the modelview matrix in a uniform
	as well so that it can be used for fogging calculations.
	(cogl_wrap_glEnable, cogl_wrap_glDisable): Enable/disable fogging.
	(cogl_wrap_glFogx, cogl_wrap_glFogxv): Fill in wrapper to set
	fogging parameters.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-vertex-shader.glsl: Calculate the
	fog amount if fogging is enabled.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl: Mix with fog
	color.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h (CoglGles2Wrapper): Add
	uniforms for fogging.

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-font.c: Remove unneeded file.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-random-text.c: Add a test for checking the
	glyph cache.

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #919 - Replacement pango renderer (Neil Roberts)

	* clutter/clutter-backend.h:
	* clutter/clutter-backend.c:
	(clutter_backend_set_font_options),
	(clutter_backend_get_font_options): Add the ability to set
	the cairo_font_options_t* for the backend at construction
	time, so that backend implementations can have their own
	options.

	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Include pango/pango-attributes.h
	for the pango_color_parse() function.

	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	(clutter_label_ensure_layout),
	(clutter_label_init), (clutter_label_set_text),
	(clutter_label_set_font_name), (clutter_label_set_ellipsize),
	(clutter_label_set_use_markup): Ensure that the cache is
	always primed when the Label changes; this makes sure that
	the cache is rebuilt outside the paint run, which should
	make the painting perform better especially on embedded
	devices.

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c:
	(clutter_entry_ensure_layout),
	(clutter_entry_init), (clutter_entry_set_text),
	(clutter_entry_set_font_name): Ditto as above.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.[ch]: Create the font-map inside the
	main context; add two new functions:

	  clutter_clear_glyph_cache()
	  clutter_set_use_mipmapped_text()

	that control the glyphs cache.

	* clutter/pango/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-fontmap.c:
	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-private.h:
	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c:
	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter.h: Rewrite the Pango renderer
	using a PangoCairo context and saving the glyphs inside a
	more efficient cache.

	* configure.ac: Depend on pangocairo instead of pangoft2.

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug 882 - Allow child properties for containers implementing the
		  ClutterContainer interface (Øyvind Kolås)

	* clutter/clutter-child-meta.[ch]: Base class for the metadata
	of a ClutterActor inside a ClutterContainer; the ChildMeta
	object implements a wrapper for storing data that is attached
	to a ClutterActor only when it's part of a ClutterContainer.
	The ChildMeta object is used to store the child properties
	accessible through the ClutterContainer API.

	* clutter/clutter-container.[ch]: Creates the ChildMeta for
	each actor, in case the Container specifies the ChildMeta
	type to use.

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add clutter-child-meta.[ch] to the build.

	* clutter/clutter-marshal.list: Add the marshaller for the
	ClutterContainer::child-notify signal.

	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Declare ClutterContainer and
	ClutterChildMeta to avoid recursive inclusion.

2008-05-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/Makefile.am: Use old-style Makefile rules for
	the stringify script so that automake won't complain.

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-script.c:
	* tests/test-script.json: Test merging the same actor from two
	different sources.

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Fix merging of objects with the same id.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	(json_object_end): If there already is an ObjectInfo under the
	parsed id, merge the construction with the currently stored
	state.

	(parse_children), (parse_signals),
	(parse_behaviours): Append the newly parsed children, signals
	and behaviours, in case the ObjectInfo already has unresolved
	items.

	(clutter_script_construct_object): Fix a typo in the type check.

	(clutter_script_init): Do not copy the key inside the hash
	table holding the objects - we are already holding it inside
	the value.

2008-05-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c (cogl_wrap_glGetFixedv):
	Filled in the wrapper for glGetFixedv

2008-05-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c: Use the wrapper for
	glTexParameteri. Call glGenerateMipmap after every change to the
	texture image data.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c: Added a wrapper for
	glTexParameteri so that it can ignore requests to set
	GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP. Added a wrapper for glGenerateMipmap that does
	nothing on GLES 1

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	(clutter_script_construct_object): Mark top-level objects,
	that is objects that don't have their ownership transferred
	when building up a ClutterScript.

	(object_info_free): Merge a fix from the stable branch, but
	do not check the type - check whether the object is a top
	level (we still need the ClutterActor type check in order to
	call clutter_actor_destroy()).

2008-05-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c:
	(clutter_rectangle_paint): Remove commented out call to
	cogl_enable(); the call is not needed and the comment is
	in C99.

2008-05-27  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.h:

	* clutter/eglx/Makefile.am: Include the GLES and EGL headers via
	clutter-egl-headers.h so that the right version can be used
	depending on whether the GLES 2 wrapper is being used.

	* configure.ac: Added an automake conditional for whether the GLES
	2 wrapper should be used.

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c (clutter_stage_egl_realize):
	Remove the call to glGetIntegerv to get the max texture size. It
	was being called before the GL context was bound so it didn't work
	anyway and it was causing trouble for the GLES 2 simulator.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/stringify.sh: Shell script to convert the
	shaders into a C string.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c: Wrappers for most of the
	missing GL functions in GLES 2.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-vertex-shader.glsl: New shaders for
	GLES 2

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-defines.h.in: Use the @CLUTTER_GL_HEADER@
	macro instead of always using the GLES 1 header.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-context.h (CoglContext): Include a field
	for the state of the GLES 2 wrapper.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-primitives.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c: Use wrapped versions of the GL
	functions where neccessary.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/Makefile.am: Add sources for the GLES 2
	wrapper and an extra build step to put the GLSL files into a C
	string whenever the files change.

2008-05-26  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c: (clutter_stage_x11_request_coords):
	Dont allow the window to be resize to 0 dimentions. (fixes #933)

2008-05-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #912 - Invalid use of int* as parameter for glGetIntegerv

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c (_cogl_features_init): Use GLint
	instead of int. (#912, Tommi Komulainen)

2008-05-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #928 - Reparenting a child that itself is a container
	doesn't work

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_set_parent): Realize
	an actor when setting its parent, if the parent is realized.

	* clutter/clutter-group.c:
	(clutter_group_realize), (clutter_group_class_init): Add the
	missing implementation of the ::realize() virtual function; this
	makes sure that the children of a Group are realized if the Group
	is realized. (#928)

2008-05-21  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c (error_string):
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c (error_string): Rename to
	_cogl_error_string and remove the static scoping so that it can be
	called in cogl-texture etc.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c (cogl_texture_new_from_foreign):
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c (cogl_texture_new_from_foreign):
	GE(*) can't be used to wrap around calls that use the return
	value.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c (_cogl_texture_quad_sw)
	(_cogl_texture_quad_hw, cogl_texture_polygon): Remove GE(*)
	wrapper around calls in the middle of a glBegin/glEnd pair which
	otherwise always generate an error because glGetError can only be
	called outside of the pair.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-internal.h: Include stdio.h when definig
	COGL_DEBUG and declare a prototype for _cogl_error_string.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-internal.h: Match GE(*) macro to GL
	version.

2008-05-21  Ivan Leben  <ivan@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	(_cogl_texture_download_from_gl:) Only comment out the broken
	check for framebuffer alpha bits, not the check for alpha in
	texture format.

2008-05-20  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	Decouple actor opacity from fill opacity in ClutterRectangle (fixes
	race when both are set from clutter script also makes it more
	consistent with the behavior of other actors.)

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: (clutter_rectangle_set_color): stop
	setting the opacity of the actor from the specified color.
	(clutter_rectangle_paint): combine the absolute opacity of the actor
	with the alpha of the color when painting.

2008-05-20  Ivan Leben  <ivan@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	(cogl_texture_download_from_gl:) Implemented a workaround
	for missing alpha framebuffer channel. There are still
	some issues with detecting whether alpha is present in the
	framebuffer. See comments in code. Test-cogl-tex-getset now
	successfully retrieves a RGBA texture image data.

2008-05-19  Ivan Leben  <ivan@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	(cogl_texture_download_from_gl:) Store old blending factors
	and restore them when done. The lack of ability to retrieve
	the alpha channel now more noticable in test-cogl-tex-getset
	since the edges of the hand are not antialiased.

	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl-internal.h: Declare
	cogl_blend_func to avoid "implicit implementation" compile
	warning.

2008-05-19  Ivan Leben  <ivan@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl.c: New internal function
	cogl_blend_func caches blending setup much like cogl_enable
	does with the enable flags. This separates blending factors
	setup from the enable/disable operation in preparation of
	the texture image retrieval fix for alpha channel on GLES.
	(cogl_enable:) Does not modify blending factors anymore.

	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl-context.h: CoglContext holds two
	new variables to cache blending src and dst factors.

	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl-context.c:
	(cogl_create_context:) Initialize blending factors.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	(cogl_texture_download_from_gl:) Set blending factors to
	CGL_ONE, CGL_ZERO which fixes the slighlty improper behavior
	where source colour was actually multiplied with its alpha
	value in the result (not noticable on current tests).

2008-05-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/Makefile.am: Fix the INCLUDE directives to
	properly include the X11 backend headers.

	* clutter/glx/Makefile.am: Add the libclutter-x11.la static
	library to the LDADD directives.

2008-05-19  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/clutter-x11.h:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx.h:
	Include texture pixmap headers.

2008-05-16  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c (clutter_stage_egl_realize):
	Fix name of parent class variable which otherwise breaks the
	build.

2008-05-16  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Use the Mesa headers instead of depending on GLee for Win32
	builds.

	* configure.ac: No longer check for GLee

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-defines.h.in: Don't bother including GLee.h

	* build/mingw/mingw-cross-compile.sh: No longer downloads libGLee
	but downloads the Mesa library instead and installs the headers
	from that. Fixed the libpng version.

2008-05-16  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/x11/Makefile.am:
	Install glx and x11 specific includes into clutter/glx and
	clutter/x11 so that header files that include glx/*.h or x11/*.h
	when installed.

2008-05-16  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/win32/clutter-event-win32.c (message_translate): Fix
	signedness of old_xpos and old_ypos to get rid of compiler
	warnings.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c
	(clutter_backend_win32_get_features): Cast the result of
	glGetString to a signed char pointer to avoid compiler warnings.

2008-05-15  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c:
	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c: Reflect changes to the
	GLX/X11 backend in revisions 2708-2709 and 2713-2715 which
	simplify the backend a little.

2008-05-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.h: Fix documentation.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.[ch]:
	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-event-egl.c: Add the same solution
	used for the SDL backend in order to get the time of an event.
	This should fix the motion event throttling and the click count
	on button press. (#906)

	* tests/test-pixmap.c (create_pixmap), (main): Fix preprocessor
	directives.

2008-05-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-threads.c: Add a "progress bar" actor and
	make the test take less amount of time to complete.

2008-05-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-events.c: Clean up a bit, and print out more
	messages when pressing one of the rectangles.

	* tests/test-threads.c: Be more verbose in the console, and
	apply another behaviour on the rectangle, to show that we
	are not blocking.

2008-05-14  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c: (_cogl_features_init): do not set
	COGL_FEATURE_TEXTURE_READ_PIXELS, since it is not available.

2008-05-14  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	Rejid Øyvind's previous commit a little moving more into
	clutter-main.c and using ClutterContext.
	Also Refactor clutter_init & clutter_init_with_args to share
	same core init code.

2008-05-13  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	Made it possible to do picking when the colors stored in the
	framebuffer are only approximately the correct value.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(init_bits): initialize constants about how many bits are
	available/will be used for r,g,b components.
	(_clutter_pix_to_id): now own function, compute an id from a
	pixel into its own function (used from _clutter_do_pick).
	(_clutter_id_to_col): now own function, computes the color to use for
	a given id.
	(clutter_actor_paint): use clutter_id_to_col.
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	(_clutter_do_pick): use _clutter_pix_to_id
	(clutter_main): re-enable invocation of fruity app shell.

2008-05-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/fruity/clutter-stage-fruity.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_show), (clutter_stage_egl_hide): Don't chain
	up and set flags, as it is not needed anymore.

	(clutter_stage_egl_realize): Set the REALIZED flag.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_show), (clutter_stage_egl_hide): Don't chain
	up and set flags, as it is not needed anymore.

2008-05-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	(clutter_stage_glx_unrealize): Move the shaders release from here...

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	(clutter_backend_glx_dispose): ... to here. Shaders should be
	released when the GL context is being destroyed, and that only
	happens when the backend is being disposed, now that we support
	multiple stages.

2008-05-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-backend.c:
	(_clutter_backend_create_stage): Call _clutter_stage_set_window()
	ourselves, thus removing yet another action that backends must
	implement and might get wrong; also cuts a backend-agnostic piece
	of code duplication.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_create_stage): Update the EGL native backend.

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_create_stage): Update the EGLX backend.

	* clutter/fruity/clutter-backend-fruity.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_create_stage): Update the fruity backend

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-backend-sdl.c:
	(clutter_backend_sdl_create_stage): Update the SDL backend.

	* HACKING.backends: Update the ::create_stage() description.

2008-05-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/clutter-event-x11.c (event_translate): Remove the
	cheap Expose event compression, as it seems to play games when a
	composite manager is running. It's also not really needed, as
	the redraw queue will avoid redraws too close to each other
	anyway.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c:
	(clutter_stage_x11_show), (clutter_stage_x11_hide): Do not chain
	up just to set the flags. This fixes a critical warning coming
	from ClutterActor::hide() default implementation.

2008-05-13  Ivan Leben  <ivan.leben@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-defines.h.in:
	Fix GL function prototypes on OS X by #definining APIENTRY and
	APIENTRYP if missing.

2008-05-12  Ivan Leben  <ivan.leben@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-defines.h.in:
	Defined GL extension functions used by Cogl inside the COGL_
	namespace.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-context.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c:
	Use COGL_ extension function prototypes instead of relying
	on glext.h to define them. Should fix the mac compilability
	bug, but haven't tested it yet.

2008-05-12  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c:
	* configure.ac:
	* tests/Makefile.am:
	Remove the XComposite dep from Clutter itself, just use
	in test-pixmap (if available)

2008-05-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Rework the stage wrapper/implementation relation: remove
	duplicated code and all the bookkeeping from the backends into
	ClutterStage whenever possible, to reduce the amount of	work a
	backend must do (and possibly get wrong). Thanks to Tommi
	Komulainen.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	(clutter_init_with_args), (clutter_init): Realize the default
	stage after creation. The default stage is special, because we
	use it in the initialization sequence. This removes the burden
	from the backends and reduces the things a backend can get
	wrong.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_show): Make sure to realize the implementation if
	it hasn't been realized yet.

	(clutter_stage_realize): Set the REALIZED flag and call
	clutter_stage_ensure_current() if the implementation was
	successfully realized.

	(clutter_stage_unrealized): Call clutter_stage_ensure_current()
	on unrealize.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	(clutter_backend_glx_create_stage): Do not realize the stage anymore
	when creating it, and let the normal realization sequence take
	place.

	(clutter_backend_glx_ensure_context): Trap for X11 errors.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	(clutter_stage_glx_realize): Chain up to the X11 implementation
	so that we can set up the window state (title, cursor visibility)
	when we actually have a X window. Also, do not call
	clutter_stage_ensure_current(), and rely on the wrapper to do
	it for us. This means we can drop setting the REALIZED flag on
	the wrapper.

	(clutter_stage_glx_unrealize): Do not call
	clutter_stage_ensure_current() ourselves, and rely on the wrapper
	to do it for us.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c:
	(set_wm_title),	(set_cursor_visible): Move the WM title and
	cursor visibility code inside their own functions.

	(clutter_stage_x11_realize): Set the window title and whether the
	cursor is visible or not after realizing the stage.

	(clutter_stage_x11_set_cursor_visible),
	(clutter_stage_x11_set_title): Call set_wm_title() and
	set_cursor_visible().

	(clutter_stage_x11_finalize): Free the title string.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.h: Save more of the stage state,
	so that we can set it even when the stage hasn't been realized
	yet.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:

	(clutter_backend_sdl_create_stage):
	* clutter/sdl/clutter-stage-sdl.c:

	* tests/test-multistage.c (on_button_press): Bail out if
	clutter_stage_new() returns NULL.

	* HACKING.backends: Update backend writing documentation.

2008-05-12  Robert Bragg  <bob@openedhand.com>

2008-05-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h: Add a flag for the
	default stage.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	(json_object_end): If the "type" member is "ClutterStage"
	and we have a "is-default" member set to true then this
	is the default stage.

	(clutter_script_construct_object): Special case the default
	stage instead of each ClutterStage.

	(object_info_free): Ditto as above.

	* tests/test-script.json: Test the creation of a non-default
	stage and the ::destroy handler to quit.

	this allows writable ClutterUnit properties.

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c:
	(clutter_value_transform_int_fixed),

	(clutter_value_transform_float_fixed): Add GValue transformation
	functions from native types (int, double, float) to ClutterFixed.

	(clutter_fixed_get_type): Register the new transformation functions.

	(param_fixed_validate): Fix validation for ClutterParamSpecUnit;
	this allows writable ClutterFixed properties.

	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in:
	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl-texture.h:
	* clutter/cogl/gl(es)/cogl-texture.c:
	cogl_texture_new_* functions take a gboolean auto_mipmap argument.
	If TRUE automatic mipmap generation is enabled during the process
	of slice texture object creation.
	(cogl_texture_new_from_foreign:) now allows mipmap min filter

	has gone all beautiful now.

2008-05-07  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-frame-source.h: Added the missing G_BEGIN_DECLS

2008-05-01  Richard Purdie  <rpurdie@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac:
	Set CLUTTER_COGL for fruity.

2008-05-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Build fixes for the SDL flavour.

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-backend-sdl.c: Remove an unused function.

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-event-sdl.c:
	(clutter_event_dispatch): Properly cast the stage pointer.

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-stage-sdl.c:
	(clutter_stage_window_iface_init): Remove the draw_to_pixbuf()
	stub and assignment.

2008-05-01  Richard Purdie  <rpurdie@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac:
	Fix up fruity flavour configure option.

2008-05-01  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-primitives.c: (_cogl_path_fill_nodes): draw
	the rasterized scanlines as an array of triangles.

2008-05-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	(clutter_behaviour_remove_all): Disconnect the ::destroy
	handler when removing all actors, to match the behaviour
	of clutter_behaviour_remove().

2008-05-01  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.c:
	* tests/test-pixmap.c:
	Fix up texture-pixmap, now works.
	Thanks to Neil for spotting we were actually using
	wrong texture type in fbconfig (COGL change).

2008-04-30  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-primitives.c: (_cogl_path_fill_nodes):
	keep track of direction we are drawing in and make sure we leave
	two intersection points when we have changed direction.

2008-04-30  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-primitives.c: (_cogl_path_fill_nodes):
	scanline rasterizer fallback for GLES without working stencil
	buffer (would benefit from optimization/smarter choice of
	datastructures).

2008-04-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c:
	(clutter_effect_closure_destroy): Do not remove the actor
	from the behaviour; the behaviour is an internal detail of the
	effect, and it will remove the actors anyway when finalized
	when g_object_unref() is called. This should guard against
	actors being destroyed while an effect is running.

2008-04-30  Robert Bragg  <bob@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c:
	In _update_area_real with depth=16 we weren't setting up the alpha
	channel.

2008-04-29  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/x11/Makefile.am:
	Revert header install locations (Mistake in previous commit,
	fixes #898)

2008-04-29  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_move_anchor_point): The
	actor position was being moved in the wrong direction. Perhaps
	this was a cut-and-paste bug from move_anchor_point_from_gravity
	because in that function ax and ay represent the old anchor
	position, but in this function they represent the new.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c: Removed shader and program functions.

	* clutter/cogl/common/cogl-handle.h: New header to define
	COGL_HANDLE_DEFINE which helps build functions to create
	reference-counted handles. This reduces the amount of duplicated
	code.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-fbo.c: Converted to use COGL_HANDLE_DEFINE
	from cogl-handle.h to avoid duplicating some of the common code.

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c:
	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in: Programs and shaders are now wrapped in
	CoglHandles instead of COGLhandles. cogl_program_destroy and
	cogl_shader_destroy is now replaced with cogl_program_unref and
	cogl_shader_unref. cogl_program_ref and cogl_shader_ref are also
	added.

	* clutter/clutter-shader.c: Converted to use CoglHandles for the
	programs and shaders instead of COGLhandles.

2008-04-29  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in: renaming of API's in cogl to make the
	primitives and path API a bit smaller and more resembling cairo.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c:
	In clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_set_pixmap, dont assume that the actor
	size should be changed to match the size of the pixmap.

2008-04-29  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c:
	Replaces an malloc call with g_malloc.

2008-04-29  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/configure.ac:
	When looking for a GLES 1 library, also try the name "GLESv1_CM".

	This also reduces the xfixes version requirement to v3, since we dont
	need support for Show/HideCursor.

2008-04-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Fixed 'make dist'

	* clutter/cogl/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute cogl.h.in

	could not find gtkdocize, but echo an empty EXTRA_DIST into it
	so that the automake won't complain later on.

2008-04-28  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in: reindented.

2008-04-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	rotation setter when parsing the rotation from a ClutterScript
	file.

	(clutter_geometry_copy),
	(clutter_vertex_copy),
	(clutter_actor_box_copy): Use the more efficient g_slice_dup().

	* autogen.sh:
	Dont display 'make' if configure fails.
	* configure.ac:
	Add new --with-gles version option for eventual GLES2 support
	Also minor tidyups.

2008-04-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* tests/test-cogl-tex-polygon.c: Added buttons to toggle whether
	slicing and linear filtering is enabled. By default slicing is
	disabled to help test on GL ES.

2008-04-28  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added $(top_srcdir)/clutter to the
	include path. Otherwise the tests will fail to build trying to
	include "json/json-types.h" when building out-of-tree.

2008-04-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:

	origin of the event.

2008-04-24  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Add the --with-json configure switch to
	allow building Clutter with the external dependency on

	by default.

2008-04-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* clutter/Makefile.am: Do not build the internal JSON-GLib
	copy if there is a system installed one.

	* clutter/clutter-json.h: Remove.

	* clutter/clutter-json.h.in: Template for the clutter-json.h
	header file, used to opaquely include the JSON-GLib types.

2008-04-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Document :show-on-set-parent and
	the fact that calling clutter_actor_show() and hide() on an
	unparented actor will change that property as well as a side
	effect.

2008-04-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_set_property): Use the

	rotation accessors.

2008-04-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug 892 - Incorrect results using rotation-[center|angle] properties

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_set_rotation_internal): Inline function for setting
	the rotation using fixed point for the angle and units for the
	center of rotation.

	(clutter_actor_set_property),
	(clutter_actor_set_rotationx): Use the internal setter to avoid
	loss of precision and too many conversions to and from units.

2008-04-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug 891 - assertion failed when test-behave exits

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	(remove_actor_on_destroy),
	(clutter_behaviour_apply),

2008-04-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #884 - Add clutter_alpha_set_closure

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.[ch]: Add clutter_alpha_set_closure(),
	a GClosure variant of clutter_alpha_set_func(), and reimplement
	the latter as a special case of the former. (#884, Xan López)

2008-04-18  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c (clutter_timeline_get_progressx):
	Changed to use clutter_qdiv instead of CLUTTER_FIXED_DIV otherwise
	it can't cope with timelines with more than 255 frames.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-frame-source.c: Small coding style fixes.

2008-04-17  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Applied patch from bug #881

	* clutter/clutter-frame-source.h:
	* clutter/clutter-frame-source.c:
	New files that contain a replacement for g_timeout that try to
	cope with system delays.

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Added clutter-frame-source.{c,h}

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c (timeout_add): Use a frame source
	instead of a g_timeout.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_threads_add_frame_source_full)
	(clutter_threads_add_frame_source): New public functions to wrap a
	frame source and grab the Clutter mutex.

	* clutter/clutter-timeout-pool.c: Now calculates the timeout
	expiration times in the same way as a frame source does so that it
	counts time in frame intervals instead of setting the next
	expiration time as an offset from the current time.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c:
	(clutter_value_transform_fixed_int),
	(clutter_value_transform_fixed_double),
	(clutter_value_transform_fixed_float),
	(clutter_fixed_get_type): Add GValue transformation functions
	for ClutterFixed; copying a CLUTTER_TYPE_FIXED GValue into
	a G_TYPE_FLOAT/G_TYPE_DOUBLE one will automatically transform
	the fixed point representation into a floating point one. Also
	add the G_TYPE_INT transformation function to do a plain
	fixed->int copy.

	* clutter/clutter-units.c:
	(clutter_value_transform_unit_int),
	(clutter_unit_get_type): Add a unit->int transformation function.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	to install and use unit based properties in a safe way.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-units.h:
	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h: Add boundaries for fixed point
	and units values.

	* doc/reference/clutter-sections.txt: Update the documentation.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* autogen.sh: Try to continue even if we don't have gtk-doc

	--disable-docs --disable-gtk-doc to autogen.sh as well.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.[ch]: Add a ClutterFixed fundamental
	type, and wrappers for storing it into GValues; also add a

	ClutterFixed values. This allows creating GObject properties
	using fixed point values.

	* doc/reference/clutter-sections.txt: Document the newly
	added API.

2008-04-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add clutter-units.c

	* clutter/clutter-units.[ch]: Add a ClutterUnit fundamental

	values. This allows creating GObject properties using units.

	* doc/reference/clutter-sections.txt: Document the newly
	added API.

2008-04-15  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	  - Add support for optionally tracking damage and automatically
	    updating texture.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.h:
	General cleanup and some safety additions. Needs more work so
	'proper' subclass - dependent on new COGL.

	Invert g_return_if check.

	* configure.ac:
	Pull in XComposite and XDamage (at least for now)

	* tests/Makefile.am:

	Add a modified test from Johan for above.

2008-04-15  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Added support for foreign windows to the Win32 backend.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c
	(clutter_stage_win32_request_coords): Don't resize foreign
	windows.
	(clutter_stage_win32_unrealize): Don't destroy foreign windows.
	(clutter_stage_win32_init): Added initialiser for is_foreign_win.
	(clutter_win32_get_stage_from_window): Resort to looking in the
	stage list if the window isn't the right window class so that it
	can still find stages with foreign windows.
	(clutter_win32_set_stage_foreign): New public function to set a
	foreign window for a stage.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-event-win32.c
	(clutter_win32_disable_event_retrieval): New public function to
	disable event retrieval.
	(message_translate): Don't handle WM_SIZE or WM_MOVE for foreign
	windows.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.h (struct
	_ClutterBackendWin32): Added a flag to disable event retrieval

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c

	Actually set wm protocols on eglx stage windows. Fixes issues with
	cloising stages and cleanup.

2008-04-14  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c: (cogl_color):
	Disable use of color4ub, issues with latest MBX SDL (#857)

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c:

	Some issues remain in destroying stages.

2008-04-14  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Bug #853

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c (clutter_timeline_get_progressx): Fix
	arithmetic for calculating the reverse progress when the timeline
	is backward. (Should subtract from one instead of taking the
	reciprocal).

2008-04-13  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Upgraded the Win32 backend to work with the multi-stage
	subclassing code.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.h:
	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c: Now inherits from
	ClutterGroup and implements ClutterStageWindow instead of
	inheriting directly from ClutterStage.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-event-win32.c (message_translate): Now
	takes an extra parameter to return whether DefWindowProc should be
	called. This is needed to prevent the default WM_CLOSE handler
	from destroying the window.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c
	(clutter_backend_win32_dispose): Destroy all of the stages using
	g_slist_foreach as per bug #871. Now also destroys the GL context.
	(clutter_backend_win32_get_features): Added assertions to ensure
	there is a valid GL context.
	(clutter_backend_win32_ensure_context): Accepts NULL stage. Gets
	implementation pointer from the stage.

2008-04-11  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-container.c:
	(clutter_container_get_type): Relax the precondition on the
	implementations of ClutterContainer from ClutterActor to
	GObject.

2008-04-11  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* README: Add a note about the Shader API changes.

	* clutter/clutter-deprecated.h: Add deprecation symbols.

	* clutter/clutter-shader.[ch]: Rename the :bound read-only
	property to :compiled. Also rename clutter_shader_bind()
	and clutter_shader_is_bound() to clutter_shader_compil() and
	clutter_shader_is_compiled(), respectively.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	(clutter_stage_glx_unrealize): Update after
	clutter_shader_release_all() rename.

	* tests/test-shader.c (button_release_cb), (main): Update.

2008-04-10  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_ensure_context): Sync up with the GLX
	backend.

	(clutter_backend_egl_create_stage): Dumb compilation fix.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	(clutter_backend_glx_create_stage): Unref the stage if we are
	erroring out.

2008-04-10  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_realize): Sync up with the GLX backend.

2008-04-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Update the regular expression to match
	all the namespaces we actually use. Thanks to Neil Roberts for
	spotting this. A make distclean is needed.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/json/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/pango/Makefile.am: Revert previous commit.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/json/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/pango/Makefile.am: Fix the visibility of all the
	symbols, for the main library and the statically linked ones.

2008-04-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* autogen.sh: Clean up a bit

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.[ch]:
	(clutter_double_to_fixed),
	(clutter_double_to_int),
	(clutter_double_to_uint): Make these functions public, as they
	are expanded by their respective macros. This fixes the errors
	from the linker trying to resolve their name.

2008-04-09  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Applied patch from bug #871

	* clutter/x11/clutter-backend-x11.c (clutter_backend_x11_dispose):
	Call g_slist_foreach instead of iterating over the stage_manager
	list manually when deleting stages. Otherwise the 'next' pointer
	of the list node can get corrupted when the actor removes itself
	from the list.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_dispose): Call
	clutter_actor_unrealize in the dispose handler. This fixes
	problems where the dispose handler for the ClutterStageWrapper
	can't deselect the GL context until the stage is unrealized.

2008-04-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-backend.c: Add more debug messages

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_is_default): Add a function to check if the
	stage is the default one.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c: Keep the stage wrapper
	and implementation flags in sync, to ensure that the GL
	context is always set.

2008-04-04  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* README: Fixed typo

2008-04-04  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* README:
	Add a note on new show-on-set-parent prop and stage subclassing.

2008-04-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Bug #864 - Allow instantiating and subclassing of ClutterStage

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add clutter-stage-window.[ch]

	* clutter/clutter-stage-manager.c:
	(_clutter_stage_manager_remove_stage): Do not warn if removing
	a stage we don't manage, as we might be invoked multiple times
	during a ClutterState dispose sequence.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-backend.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.[ch]: Make ClutterStage a proxy actor,
	with a private actor implementing the ClutterStageWindow
	interface for handling the per-backend realization, painting
	and unrealization, plus all the windowing system abstraction.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-event-x11.c:
	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.[ch]: Port the X11 backend
	to the new backend and stage API and semantics.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c: Port the GLX backend to
	the new backend and stage API and semantics.

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.[ch]:
	* clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.[ch]: Port the EGLX backend
	to the new backend and stage API and semantics (untested).

	* tests/test-multistage.c (on_button_press): Rename
	clutter_stage_create_new() to clutter_stage_new().

2008-04-04  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Applied patch from bug #810.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-event-x11.c (event_translate): Set a flag
	when resizing the stage from a ConfigureNotify event.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c
	(clutter_stage_x11_request_coords): Don't try to resize the window
	again if the flag is set.
	(clutter_stage_x11_init): Added initialiser for the flag.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.h (struct _ClutterStageX11): Added
	the flag.

2008-04-04  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	Remove uneeded stage private member.
	Add show-on-set-parent prop and make so by default Actors are
	now automatically shown when reparented (#791)

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c:
	A couple of minor comments.

	* clutter/eglnative/Makefile.am:
	Add missing clutter-egl.h header (back port from trunk)

	* tests/test-actors.c:
	Modify to take advantage of new show-on-set-parent functionality.

2008-04-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Only export symbols matching "^clutter.*",
	to avoid exposing the library-private symbols starting with
	an underscore.

2008-04-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: ClutterAlpha is an InitiallyUnowned
	subclass. This should fix a lot of leakage. (#860, Neil Roberts)

2008-04-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	(clutter_backend_glx_get_features): Assert if we don't have a
	GL context here or if it's not matched to a drawable. Asserting
	might seem too drastic, but if we don't have a valid GL context
	here then Clutter will segfault anyway, and I'll take an assert()
	over a hard to read, deep in GLX guts backtrace any day (and
	twice on a monday).

	* clutter/x11/clutter-backend-x11.c:
	(clutter_backend_x11_get_features): No need for a variable here.

2008-04-01  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-backend.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	Allow NULL to be passed to _clutter_backend_ensure_context
	which essentially clears GL context. This is hooked into stage
	unrealisation.  Isn't yet quite bulletproof.
	Fixes issues with gtk-embed crasher (thanks to Neil).

2008-04-1  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx-texture-pixmap.c:
	In clutter_glx_texture_pixmap_dispose; trap X errors around
	glXDestroyGLXPixmap so we can't die due to BadDrawable errors.

2008-03-31  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* README:
	Add notes on new multistage feature.

	* clutter/clutter-stage-manager.c:
	Dont ref contained stages.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	Automatically remove stage from stage manager on finalisation.
	Cleans up warnings when a stage is destroyed.

	* clutter/clutter-backend.h:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c:
	Minor formatting cleanups.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c:
	* configure.ac:
	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in:
	Add a general CLUTTER_STAGE_TYPE define, should be useful for
	evntual stage subclassing and creating with g_object_new()

2008-03-30  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c
	(clutter_backend_win32_init): Added a call to
	timeBeginPeriod. Without this the frame rates are terrible because
	the glib timeouts are not accurate enough. However this requires
	Glib >= 2.16.0 to take any effect because of a change in the way
	g_poll is implemented. See revision 6597 of glib.
	(clutter_backend_win32_finalize): Added a call to timeEndPeriod.

	* configure.ac: Added -lwinmm to the library dependencies for the
	Win32 backend.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.h:
	* clutter/win32/clutter-backend-win32.c:
	Upgraded for multi-stage support.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c
	(clutter_stage_win32_request_coords): Fixed so that it doesn't set
	the position or size if it hasn't changed. This was causing
	problems when the window was resized using the top left corner. In
	that case the window receives resize and move messages separately
	which caused the window to flash at a different size or position
	while one message was handled before the other.
	(clutter_stage_win32_realize): Added PFD_GENERIC_ACCELERATED to
	the list of pixel format flags to force it to use hardware
	acceleration.

2008-03-26  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/win32/clutter-win32.h: Added gtk-doc documentation for
	the Win32 backend section.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-stage-win32.c
	(clutter_win32_get_stage_window): Fixed punctuation in the

	PeekMessage.

2008-03-25  Neil Roberts  <neil@o-hand.com>

	Added a native Win32 WGL backend.

	* configure.ac: Added the 'win32' flavour.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c (cogl_get_proc_address): Added an ifdef
	to use wglGetProcAddress with the Win32 backend.

	* clutter/Makefile.am (DIST_SUBDIRS): Added the win32 directory.

	* clutter/win32/clutter-win32.pc.in:

	* clutter/clutter-model.[ch]: Add a ::copy() virtual function
	for copying iterators.

	* clutter/clutter-list-model.c:
	(clutter_list_model_iter_copy),
	(clutter_list_model_iter_class_init): Implement the ::copy()
	function inside the ListModel iterator subclass.

2008-03-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-group.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Use CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_VISIBLE()
	and not CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_MAPPED().

2008-03-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-score.[ch]: Small clean ups and refactoring.
	Use gulong instead of guint, so we have a bigger id space for
	the timelines inside a Score.

2008-03-19  Chris Lord  <chris@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(_clutter_actor_apply_modelview_transform), (clutter_actor_paint):
	Apply clip inside paint function instead of transform function

2008-03-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-score.c: Update documentation.

2008-03-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-score.[ch]: Remove all the API changes, and
	just add a clutter_score_append_at_marker(); the implementation
	remains the same, but the marker must be explicitly created by
	the developer. The ids are no longer used to create implicit
	markers, so they can return to be unsigned integers. (#450)

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.[ch]:
	(clutter_timeline_has_marker): Add a function to query a timeline
	for a marker being set.

	* tests/test-score.c (main): Update with the API changes.

	* clutter.symbols: Update exported symbols.

2008-03-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Small clean ups in the coding style.

2008-03-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.symbols: Add new symbols

	* clutter/clutter-score.[ch]: Use the newly added marker API
	on the timelines to implement attaching timelines at specific
	points, using either milliseconds or frames.

	* tests/test-score.c (main): Test the new API.

2008-03-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-marshal.list: Add signature for the
	::marker-reached signal marshaller.

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.[ch]: Add timeline marker API;
	using markers it is possible to add a unique identifier to
	a particular frame of the timeline, and receive a signal
	notification when reaching that particular marker while
	playing the timeline. (#641)

	* tests/test-timeline.c: Update the test case to check for
	the marker-reached signal emission.

	* clutter.symbols: Add new symbols.

2008-03-10  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* tests/test-shader.c: improved readability of fragment shader
	examples by factoring out common bits into FRAGMENT_SHADER_BEGIN and
	FRAGMENT_SHADER_END macros.

2008-03-09  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-id-pool.c: (clutter_id_pool_free):
	Use g_slice_free not g_free.

	Dont 'over read' the framebuffer when picking (#839, Neil Roberts)

2008-03-07  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	Refactored the integer id->ClutterActor mapping code to be a self
	contained data structure.

	* clutter/clutter-id-pool.[ch]: new files.
	* clutter/Makefile.am: added clutter-id-pool.[ch]
	* clutter/clutter-private.h: use a ClutterIDPool instead of GArray and
	GSList to keep track of the reusable ids.
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: moved id pool logic away.
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: simplified id pool creation/finalization.

2008-03-07  Robert Bragg  <bob@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c:
	Timeline changes to fix the issues identified in bugzilla #439

	Notably, this includes some tweaks to timeline semantics.
	So e.g. for a

	10 frame timeline here are some points about the new timeline code:

	- When you create a timeline it starts with current_frame_num == 0

	- After starting a timeline, the first timeout is for
	  current_frame_num == 1 (Notably it isn't 0 since there is a delay
	  before the first timeout signals so re-asserting the starting point
	  would give a longer than average first frame.)

	- For a non looping timeline the last timeout would be for
	  current_frame_num == 10

	- For a looping timeline the timeout for current_frame_num ==
	  10 would be followed by a timeout for current_frame_num == 1
	  and frame 0 is considered == frame 10.

	- Asking for a timeline of N frames might better be described
	  as asking for a timeline of _length_ N.

	Warning: Although I tried to test things, I guess it's quite
	likely that this breaks somthing depending on a specific quirk
	of the previous timeline code.

2008-03-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_set_anchor_point_from_gravity): Fix a stupid
	conversion from pixels to units that should I not have made.

2008-03-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* README: Update the release notes.

2008-03-06  Gwenole Beauchesne  <gbeauchesne@splitted-desktop.org>

	Signed off by: Emmanuele Bassi <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-group.c (clutter_group_real_lower): Fix to

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c:
	(clutter_entry_handle_key_event_internal),
	(clutter_entry_key_press), (clutter_entry_class_init),
	(clutter_entry_handle_key_event): Provide a default class handler
	for the key-press-event, so that giving key focus to an entry will
	automatically make it work. This deprecates the
	clutter_entry_handle_key_event() function. (#824)

	* tests/test-entry.c (main): Remove the handle_key_event()
	machinery, and just give focus to the entry.

2008-03-06  Chris Lord  <chris@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-model.c: (clutter_model_set_sorting_column):
	Don't disable sorting on column 0

	properties to the ClutterActor class.

	(clutter_actor_set_anchor_point),
	(clutter_actor_set_anchor_pointu),
	(clutter_actor_set_anchor_point_from_gravity): Reimplement
	the pixel based and gravity based API using the units based
	one. Emit the ::notify signal for the :anchor-x and :anchor-y
	properties.

	(parse_units),
	(clutter_actor_parse_custom_node): Parse the :anchor-x and
	:anchor-y properties using the custom units format (mm, px,
	pt and %).

	* tests/test-script.json: Test the newly added properties.

2008-03-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Add "osx" the the AC_HELP_STRING of the flavour
	selection. (#831, Peter Enzerink)

2008-03-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_do_event): Do not throttle the
	motion events if the per-actor delivery has been disabled.

2008-03-04  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c: (draw_glyph): use g_slice_new0
	instead of g_slice_new when allocating the glyph_info, avoiding a
	branch based on uninitialized memory.

2008-03-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* Makefile.am: Do not recurse into doc if we did not explicitly
	enabled the documentation build; we just recurse into doc if we
	are doing a dist or a distcheck.

2008-02-29  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	Reuse the numeric id's used for picking actors to avoid the potential
	of overflowing the id numbers when continusly creating and destroying
	actors on long running applications for 16bpp.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: replaced hashtable with GArray and a
	GSList for available slots in the array.
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: (create_actor_id): function to create an
	actor->id mapping, (release_actor_id): function to mark an existing id
	as available for reuse.
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: (clutter_context_free): added utility
	function for cleaning up the context,
	(clutter_get_actor_by_gid): use the GArray for looking up actors.

2008-02-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c:
	(clutter_exp_inc_func),	(clutter_exp_dec_func): Clamp the value
	of the alpha function between [0, MAX_ALPHA]. (#800)

2008-02-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (emit_event): Fix the last commit
	which inverted a condition.

2008-02-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Remove the usage of g_return_if_fail()
	from static functions: either assert or use g_warning() to check
	internal state, as g_return_if_fail() can be compiled out.

       Disable the depth test and buffer as has some strange side
       effects, mainly on x/y axis rotation with multiple layers at

       effect). Seems no clean 100% effective way to fix without other

       cogl_enable_depth_test() as for custom actors (i.e groups) to

	the python bindings. (#720)

2008-01-21  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-group.c:
	Make sure unrealizing a group also unrealizes children.

	reference we hold on the actor, as it was preventing the finalization
	of every child on the stage.

2007-11-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c:
	(clutter_stage_x11_set_cursor_visible): Restore the XFixes usage,
	as it now seems to be have been fixed.

2007-11-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_real_show),
	(clutter_actor_real_hide): Do not set the MAPPED flag on the actor
	if it is a top-level one (like ClutterStage); the backends are
	responsible for setting that flag, as it might be the result of an
	asynchronous operation (e.g. on X11).

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_show),
	(clutter_stage_egl_hide): Set/unset the CLUTTER_ACTOR_MAPPED flag
	on show and hide respectively.

	* clutter/osx/clutter-stage-osx.c:
	(clutter_stage_osx_show),
	(clutter_stage_osx_hide): Ditto as above.

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-stage-sdl.c:
	(clutter_stage_sdl_show),
	(clutter_stage_sdl_hide): Ditto as above, plus chain up to the
	parent class show/hide virtual functions.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-event-x11.c (event_translate): Use the MapNotify
	and UnmapNotify events to call the X11 stage map/unmap functions.

	* clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.[ch]:
	(clutter_stage_x11_set_fullscreen): Set the fullscreen_on_map flag
	with the fullscreen value.

	(clutter_stage_x11_map), (clutter_stage_x11_unmap): Set the MAPPED
	flag on the stage actor and redraw; also, if the fullscreen_on_map
	flag was set, call clutter_stage_fullscreen() as well. (#648)

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-fullscreen.c: Add a fullscreen test case for checking
	whether fullscreen works on every backend/platform.

2007-11-23  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_real_request_coords),
	(clutter_actor_request_coords),
	(clutter_actor_class_init): Provide a default ::request_coords()
	implementation in ClutterActor and use it to store the bounding
	box passed to clutter_actor_request_coords(). This makes the code
	more reliable and clean, and avoids a call to the subclass
	request_coords() method if the bounding box did not change. Now,
	every class overriding ClutterActor::request_coords() *must* chain
	up to the parent class method or the bounding box will not be
	saved inside the ClutterActor structure.

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c:
	* clutter/clutter-group.c:

2007-11-08  Rob Bradford  <rob@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/gles/cogl.c: (cogl_color):
	Switch over to using glColor4ub in the GLES backend. It's available in
	the header file but missing in the reference manual.

2007-11-07  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.[ch]: Fix the declaration of the
	class handlers for the ::captured-event, ::enter-event and
	::leave-event signals; the function signatures were missing
	the return value the signals marshallers were expecting, and
	their names weren't respecting the convention for event-related
	signals.

2007-11-06  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h:
	Added CLUTTER_SQRTI_ARG_MAX, CLUTTER_SQRTI_5_PERCENT,
	CLUTTER_SQRTI_10_PERCENT expressing clutter_sqrti limits.
	Stripped trailing whitespace.

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c:
	(clutter_sqrti):
	Updated documentation, stripped trailing whitespace.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	(node_distance):
	Use clib sqrt if clutter_sqrti() precission would be worse than
	10%.
	Stripped trailing whitespace.

2007-11-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-layout.h: Add commodity macros to test for
	a specific layout flag in one line.

2007-11-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-box.c (clutter_box_dispose): Call unparent()
	on the children, instead of destroy(), to avoid a double free
	and a crash when destroying a ClutterBox.

2007-11-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c: Break the references in ::dispose,
	and free the resources in ::finalize.

2007-11-05  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-container.[ch]: removed find_child_by_id method
	from interface (and all implementations of it) since this
	functionality is now implemented using a global hash.
	* clutter/clutter-box.c:
	* clutter/clutter-group.c:

2007-11-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Various minor improvements to ClutterScore.

2007-10-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-layout.c: Fix documentation, with regards to
	the containers handling of the children implementing the
	ClutterLayout interface.

2007-10-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-defines.h.in: The OS X backend has a funny
	OpenGL header location, so it basically did break every application
	including clutter/cogl.h because the GL header inclusion depended
	on symbols defined into Clutter's config.h. Now, we define the
	GL header into the configure template and use it to create the
	cogl-defines.h file cogl.h includes.

2007-10-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/json/json-parser.c: Enable parsing of negative numbers;
	GScanner splits negative numbers into two tokens, so we need to
	special case them.

2007-10-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Add the :filename and :filename-set
	properties, to retrieve the path of the currently parsed file (if
	:filename-set is TRUE) from the ClutterScriptable implementations.

2007-10-28  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c:
	Small doc fix (#584)

2007-10-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/json/json-parser.c:
	(json_scanner_msg_handler): Set the GError to be returned by
	the parsing functions into the GScanner error message handler.

	(json_parser_object): Return the symbol token in case we have
	a parse error after the member name.

	(json_parser_load_from_data): Propagate the error set in the
	message handler, if any.

	* clutter/json/json-node.c (json_node_free): Unref the objects
	only if are set, to avoid a couple of needless criticals we
	get on error.

	* tests/test-script.json: More properties.

2007-10-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.[ch]: Slight API change in the
	clutter_script_get_objects() function: now it takes
	object name/object return location pairs and returns the
	number of objects found and returned.

	* tests/test-script.c: Exercise the clutter_script_get_objects()
	function.

2007-10-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	CGL_ENABLE_BLEND flag instead of CGL_BLEND value. (#580,
	Gwenole Beauchesne)

2007-10-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.c (clutter_color_to_string): Update the
	documentation for the format of the returned string, and remove
	the note: now clutter_color_parse() can parse the string this
	function returns.

2007-10-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c: Last usage of guint
	replaced with COGLuint. (Tommi Komulainen)

	Switch from use of guint to COGLuint. Avoids problems when
	guint != GLuint on some platforms, i.e OSX.
	(Tommi Komulainen, #525, #523)

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/osx/Makefile.am:

2007-10-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add a --clutter-default-fps run-time
	switch and CLUTTER_DEFAULT_FPS environment variable support for
	setting the default frame-rate at run-time.

2007-10-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Add a ::get_type_from_name() virtual
	function for bindings to override. The current implementation
	calls g_type_from_name() and our lazy class resolver.

	* clutter.symbols: Update.

	* doc/reference/clutter-sections.txt: Update.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Reverse the list of
	parsed knots, to preserve the real ordering after prepending
	them (thanks to Øyvind for spotting this).

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-bspline.c: Ditto as above.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-script.c:
	* tests/test-script.json: Rejig the test case and add a
	path behaviour to test the knot parsing code.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/cogl/cogl.h: Do not include <clutter/clutter.h>.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Implement the
	ClutterScriptableIface to parse the custom "knots" property.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c (clutter_texture_set_property): Do
	not try to set NULL pixbufs.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Implement part of the ClutterScriptable
	interface, using the ClutterActor API to set and get the name
	of an actor.

	(clutter_geometry_copy), (clutter_geometry_free): Use
	the slice allocator to avoid fragmentation when setting
	properties and emitting signals (that is: when packing
	boxed types into GValues).

	(clutter_actor_box_copy), (clutter_actor_box_free),
	(clutter_vertex_copy), (clutter_vertex_free): Ditto.

	COGL API, which avoid including clutter/cogl.h when writing
	container actors outside Clutter.

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h:
	* clutter/clutter-scriptable.[ch]: Add the ClutterScriptable
	interface; by implementing this interface, a class can
	override the UI definition parsing and transform complex data
	types into GObject properties, or allow custom properties.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c:
	* clutter/clutter-script-parser.c:
	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h: Rearrange the code and
	use the ClutterScriptable interface to parse and build the
	custom properties. This cleans up the code and also it makes
	it more reliable (the complex type parsing is now done using
	the target type and not just the name of the property).

2007-10-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-json.h: Header for including the JSON
	parsing and data types.

	* clutter/json/json-types.h: Add JSON_NODE_VALUE_TYPE() macro.

	* clutter/json/Makefile.am: Install the JSON headers into a
	private location. This might change in the future, and might
	also cause collisions if you're using JSON-GLib and Clutter
	at the same time, so be warned.

2007-10-22  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c (clutter_label_request_coords): If
	we get a size requisition, and we have ellipsization active,
	check if we are getting less space than what the layout needs
	and recompute the width.

2007-10-22  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.c (clutter_color_to_string): Change
	the print format to "%02x%02x%02x%02x" because we use guint8
	for each component, not guint16.

2007-10-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c (clutter_entry_paint): Fixed off by
	one error. (#566, Gwenole Beauchesne)

	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.h:

	as they have a "type" member, a unique id will be provided.

	(json_object_end): Add merge id to the object information
	structure.

	(apply_behaviours), (add_children): Keep the unresolved
	objects around.

	(construct_stage), (clutter_script_construct_object): If an
	object has unresolved children or behaviours try resolving
	them when we ask for it.

	(json_parse_end), (clutter_script_ensure_objects): Ensure
	that the objects are fully constructed as best as we can when
	finished parsing.

	(object_info_free), (remove_by_merge_id):
	(clutter_script_unmerge_objects): Remove objects under the
	same merge id returned by the loading functions. (Fixes
	bug #558)

	* test/test-script.c:
	* test/test-script.json: Test unresolved merging and unmerging
	in ClutterScript.

2007-10-18  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-score.c:
	* clutter/clutter-score.h:
	* tests/test-score.c:
	Implement more ClutterScore functionality.

2007-10-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_set_property), (clutter_actor_get_property),
	(clutter_actor_class_init): Add the :reactive property, to
	control reactiveness using the UI definition files.

	(clutter_actor_reparent): Do not assume the parent is a
	ClutterContainer, and call the container API only if needed.

	just like the documentation says.

2007-10-16  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c: (tc_get): Provide for blank
	rows/columns of pixels between adjecant glyphs in the texture cache to
	avoid bilinear interpolation spillage at edges of glyphs.

	passed id of the parent texture.

2007-10-16  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.[ch]: Added ClutterTimeline:duration,
	a property for setting the duration of a timeline in milliseconds.
	The property comes with accessors and a new constructor. The
	frame rate used is the default value.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.[ch]: Add clutter_get_default_frame_rate()
	and clutter_set_default_frame_rate(); these two functions control

	* clutter/clutter-script.c (construct_timline),
	(parse_member_to_property): Transfer ownership of the

	and behaviours.

2007-10-12  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@o-hand.com>

	replacement for GLib 2.12.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Clean up the complex properties
	parsing code.

2007-10-10  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Unreference the created objects
	only if they are top-levels, like ClutterBehaviour and
	ClutterTimelines. Actors have floating references, so we
	just transfer ownership to their containers, and the stage
	is owned by the backend. Add the "type_func" key to the
	object definition, so the user can supply its own GType
	function if the class name doesn't follow the GObject rules.
	Document the ClutterScript public API.

2007-10-10  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:

	its own file and exercise clutter_script_load_from_file().

2007-10-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.c (clutter_script_get_object): Construct
	the requested object if it hasn't been already. This allows
	referencing objects within the same snippet.

	* tests/test-script.c: Declare a timeline and use it inside
	multiple behaviours; apply multiple behaviours to various
	actors, then retrieve the timeline to start it when the test
	runs.

2007-10-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Allow applying behaviours directly

2007-10-09  Rob Bradford  <rob@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	(clutter_backend_egl_dispose):
	Call eglTerminate() on the display when the backend is disposed of.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-stage-egl.c:
	(clutter_stage_egl_realize):
	Don't use the createNativeWindow() call, it's not generic EGL.

2007-10-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Add licensing information to
	the newly added files.

	* clutter/clutter-script.c: Support creating behaviours with
	ClutterScript. ClutterAlpha objects are implicit, but
	timelines can be both explicit objects using their id or
	implicit objects. Make the property resolution and translation
	more robust. Support the pixbuf property.

	* tests/test-script.c: Test the newly added features.

	* docs/reference/clutter-docs.sgml:
	* docs/reference/clutter-sections.txt: Add ClutterScript.

2007-10-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	Add a hash to global clutter context mapping all parented actor
	id's to actors.
	Add clutter_get_actor_by_id() call.
	Convert picking machinery to use above.
	(performance/simpler composite actor creation)

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: (clutter_stage_fullscreen),
	(clutter_stage_unfullscreen), (clutter_stage_event):
	Only set the fullscreen property on stage state fullscreen event(#545)
	Experimental as could be painful to implement on non X backends.

2007-10-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-script.c (json_parse_end):
	* clutter/json/json-object.c (json_object_get_members): Replace
	the GLib 2.14 API with the equivalent code for GLib < 2.14.

	* configure.ac: Revert the dependency bump.

2007-10-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Initial implementation of the UI definition files. (#424)

	* clutter/json/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/json/*.[ch]: In-tree copy of JSON-GLib, a GLib-based
	JSON parser/generator library. We use it in-tree because we might
	need to change the API. Ideally, we'd depend on it.

	* clutter/clutter.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-script.[ch]: ClutterScript, the scenegraph
	generator class. It parses JSON streams in form of buffers and
	files and builds the scene.

	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add a "script" debug flag

	* clutter/Makefile.am: Build glue.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-script.c: Add a test case for the ClutterScript.

	* configure.ac: Depend on GLib 2.14, so we can use the
	g_hash_table_get_key() and g_hash_table_get_values() functions
	for the time being; we can probably reimplement those, but we
	are going to need 2.14 anyway if we are going to implement a
	list model using GSequence.

2007-10-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-behave.c: Use the right return type for the
	event callbacks.

	a click_count member.
	Move calculating click counts from backend to do_event()
	Initial implementation of ENTER/LEAVE events.

	* tests/test-events.c:
	Add code to test above.

	* tests/test-behave.c:
	Sync with newer API.

	* clutter/clutter-score.c:
	Silence a warning.

2007-10-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h: Add CLUTTER_FIXED_TO_INT() and
	deprecate CLUTTER_FIXED_INT(), for symmetry with

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-depth.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h: Use CLUTTER_FIXED_TO_INT().

2007-10-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_get_size): Implement
	get_size() as a wrapper around clutter_actor_query_coords()
	instead of calling g_object_get() twice.

	(clutter_actor_init): Initialise the box in one call.

2007-10-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.[ch]: Remove the ::event-after signal
	class handler, as it's not meant to be overridden by sub-classes.

	(clutter_actor_class_init):
	Make every event-related signal return a boolean: return TRUE
	in a signal handler to block the emission. The value is accumulated
	automatically by the signal API.

	(clutter_actor_event): If ::event returns TRUE, skip to emitting
	::event-after. Return the value accumulated by the signal emission
	chain.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Rename _clutter_boolean_accumlator().

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_do_event): If clutter_actor_event()
	returns TRUE then stop the event emission chain from child to parent.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_event): Behave like
	clutter_actor_event().

	(clutter_stage_get_key_focus),
	(clutter_stage_set_key_focus): Avoid a nasty circular reference
	issue: if the actor passed to set_key_focus is NULL then the stage
	has the key focus.

	* tests/test-events.c: Update the events test with the API
	changes.

2007-10-01  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	(clutter_actor_set_scale_with_gravityx):
	Use CLUTTER_QMUL for better precission (#532, patch by Gwenole
	Beauchesne).

	(clutter_color_to_hlsx):
	Added missing CLUTTER_INT_TO_FIXED conversion (#544, patch by Neil
	Roberts).

	Optimise sort_z_order.

2007-09-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Merge from stable

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-event-egl.c:
	Flag every device click after the first as motion events
	instead of button presses. (#505, Shreyas Srinivasan)

2007-09-10  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	Port from stable branch.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-event-egl.c: (clutter_event_dispatch):
	Only declare tsevent if we have tslib (#498, Robert Bragg)

2007-09-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: Remove stray include <gdk-pixbuf-xlib.h>
	in ClutterStage: the code requesting it was moved in the backends.

2007-08-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: Fix the border drawing: do not
	overdraw the rectangle on the border and fix the check for
	different border colour. (#488, Neil Roberts)

2007-08-29  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c: (clutter_effect_template_set_property):
	Add missing break statement. Whoops.

2007-08-29  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: (_clutter_do_pick):

	Above fixes via	Kate Alhola.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx.h:
	Add missing filter funcs so there actually exported

2007-08-24  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:

	* clutter/glx/clutter-event-glx.c:
	* clutter/sdl/clutter-event-sdl.c: Update backends.

2007-08-22  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:

	Fixed CCW rotation in rotate behaviour (bug 483); fixed overall
	path length calculation for angles > 360 in rotate and ellipse.

2007-08-22  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_threads_dispatch_free): Remove
	the main threads locking calls: the main loop might remove the
	source while dispatching it, so whether or not we are already
	holding the lock is unpredictable for the library. Leave a comment
	with the relevant bug number in GNOME's Bugzilla and wait for a
	fix in GLib.

2007-08-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-event.c: Correctly initialise the state
	variables used to detect multiple clicks.

	(clutter_event_get_coords): Return the coordinates for
	CLUTTER_3BUTTON_PRESS events.

	(clutter_events_pending): Check from the tail of the queue backward,
	like we do in clutter_event_get() and clutter_event_peek().

2007-08-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Preserve the ordering of the events in the queue when sythesising
	new events in the event translation sequence. (#481)

	* clutter/clutter-event.c:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Allow flagging new events on the
	events queue without breaking ClutterEvent using a masked type.

	(clutter_event_get), (clutter_event_put),
	(clutter_event_pending): Ignore events with the CLUTTER_EVENT_PENDING
	flag set when walking the events queue.

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-event-egl.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-event-glx.c:
	* clutter/sdl/clutter-event-sdl.c: Push the new events straight
	on the queue, with the CLUTTER_EVENT_PENDING flag set; remove the
	flag if the event translation was succesful, or remove the event
	altogether.

2007-08-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: Add missing documentation for the
	ClutterStage properties.

2007-08-21  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c:
	(clutter_sqrti):

	Fixes for 64-bit platforms; use of SSE builtin when available
	(bugs 478, 479, patches by Gwenole Beauchesne).

2007-08-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter-enum-types.h.in:
	* clutter/clutter-enum-types.c.in: Use template files for
	glib-mkenums; this makes the Makefile template a bit more
	clean and the enum types generation more customisable (e.g.
	when GLib 2.14 has been released, we can use g_once_init_enter()
	and g_once_init_leave() to have thread-safe GType functions
	for the enum types as well).

2007-08-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Fix CLUTTER_CHECK_VERSION()
	macro to accept micro versions. (#477, Neil Roberts)

2007-08-19  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Various timeline related changes.

	* clutter/clutter-timeout-pool.c: Use g_list_insert_sorted() to
	fix a timeout pool reversal happening with our homegrown
	sorted insertion function. (see #470)

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-timeline.c: Add a ClutterTimeline test suite, for
	finding regressions in the behaviour of the timelines. (#470,
	Rob Bradford)

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_do_event): Use an EVENT note,
	not a SCHEDULER one; SCHEDULER is for timelines and idle sources
	only.

	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Protect the bare numbers of
	the version components.

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c: Do not unref the ClutterAlpha, as
	the ownership is already of the behaviour used by the effect
	closure.

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Emit the ::new-frame signal only
	if the timeline is still active

	Always advance at least of one frame. (#471, Rob Bradford)

	Do not rewind the timeline if the user paused it in the ::new-frame
	signal handler: either the user has already done it with
	clutter_timeline_stop() or it's not what he's expecting if he
	called clutter_timeline_pause(). (#372, Johan Bilien)

	If we skipped the last frame before emitting the ::complete
	signal, emit ::new-frame with the last frame.

	Do not call clutter_timeline_stop() at the end of a non-looping
	timeline, as it emits the ::pause signal as well. Also, rewind the
	timeline *after* emitting ::complete, so that calling
	clutter_timeline_get_current_frame() in a signal handler still
	works.

2007-08-19  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-event-egl.c: (clutter_event_dispatch):
	Fix clutter_thread typo (Kate Alhola)

2007-08-18  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Update the Since: tag for the
	backported API.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.c: Fix a typo in the get_center()
	method. (#468, Neil Roberts)

	Freeze and thaw the notification queue when changing multiple
	properties in the same method. Fix some coding style issues.

2007-08-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Add checks for the "reactive" flag
	accessors.

2007-08-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-effect.[ch]: Add clutter_effect_depth(), a
	simple wrapper around ClutterBehaviourDepth. (#464, Ali Sabil)

2007-08-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c (clutter_smoothstep_inc): Use the
	correct type for parameters, to avoid overflow  (Ali Sabil).

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c: Use the right format
	when printing the unsigned alpha value and opacity to the
	debug output.

2007-08-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-container.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-group.c: Rename clutter_container_raise() to
	clutter_container_raise_child(), and clutter_container_lower()
	to clutter_container_lower_child() to avoid clashing with
	ClutterActor raise() and lower() respectively.

	* clutter/clutter-container.[ch]: Add find_child_by_id(),
	raise(), lower() and sort_depth_order() virtual functions to
	ClutterContainer.

	* clutter/clutter-group.[ch]: Deprecate the redundant calls
	from ClutterGroup, and make ClutterGroup implement them as part
	of the ClutterContainer interface implementation.

	* clutter/clutter-box.c: Implement the newly added ClutterContainer
	methods; now clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos() works with boxes
	as well as groups.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Replace calls to ClutterGroup functions
	with ClutterContainer ones.

	* clutter/clutter-timeout-pool.c: Fix removing and adding timeouts
	to the timeout pool during a dispatch of a timeout source already
	inside the pool. (#456, based on a patch by Neil Roberts)

	(clutter_timeout_dispatch), (clutter_timeout_pool_dispatch): Hold
	the main Clutter lock in the pool dispatch function, instead of
	the per-timeout dispatch; this guarantees that the ref+unref of
	the single timeouts are done under the main lock.

2007-08-12  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: (texture_upload_data):
	Align texture data correctly for edge tiles.
	(#422 - Neil Roberts)

2007-08-11  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	 Fix typo in clutter_texture_get_pixbuf (#458, Neil Roberts).
	 Use take_object when getting pixbuf prop to avoid ref leak. (Neil
	 Roberts)

2007-08-09  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-box.c: Rename a variable to fix a compiler
	warning.

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_get_tiltx): Remove useless
	"Return" in the API documentation.

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeout-pool.c: Fix sorting of the pool
	when inserting and removing timeout sources. (#449, Neil
	Roberts)

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_get_timestamp): Remove
	the microseconds remainder, which is mostly useless. (#447)

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_get_timestamp): Return the
	correct number of microseconds (#447, Neil Roberts)

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Merge the clutter.git/threading branch.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-main.h:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Add threading locking and unlocking
	functions, to mark a critical section and access the Clutter API
	from differen threads. Add an initialisation function and a function
	to override the default lock aquisition and release functions, for
	bindings and application-specific locking handling. Add MT-safe
	versions of g_idle_add() and g_timeout_add() which will call the
	functions under the main Clutter lock and without races. The
	Clutter thread-safe implementation is basically the same used by
	GDK, so the same caveats apply.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeout-pool.c: Use the new threading API when
	invoking idle and timeouts.

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-event-egl.c:
	* clutter/eglx/clutter-event-egl.c:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-event-glx.c:
	* clutter/sdl/clutter-event-sdl.c: Acquire and release the main
	Clutter lock when preparing, checking and dispatching the events
	on the queue in every backend.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-threads.c: Add a test case, showing how to use the
	threading API and write thread-safe Clutter applications.

2007-08-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Bump up to 0.5.0 and start the new development
	branch.

2007-08-07  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.h:
	Add documentation.

	* clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c: (cogl_perspective):
	Remove CFX_* shortened macros

2007-08-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.[ch]: Remove clutter_threads_enter()
	and clutter_threads_leave(); both are no-ops and they just
	confuse things. The thread-awareness in Clutter is planned
	for 0.4.1/0.5.0.

	* README:
	* NEWS: Update.

2007-08-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-box.[ch]: Implement margin, color and default
	padding for ClutterBox. Provide API to pack a child by specifying
	every packing detail or just pack with the defaults. ClutterBox
	works like the HTML boxing model, API-wise: a box with margins
	and padding around each child. Needs work, still.

	* clutter/clutter-hbox.c:
	* clutter/clutter-vbox.c: Update with the new API and new attributes.

	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Add ClutterMargin and ClutterPadding.

	* test/test-boxes.c: Exercise the new API.

2007-08-06  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	Correct set pixbuf property as GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF
	(fix via Neil Roberts)

2007-08-06  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-depth.c:
	Modify to work like all other behvaiours in not forcing
	increasing order in behaviour 'limits'. (#436)
	Rename limit min/max props to start/end.

	* tests/test-depth.c:
	Simplify test-case to work with above change and
	without multiple ramps

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.c:
	Handle CW rotation when end > start and similar for CCW just
	like ellipse behaviour.

2007-08-05  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* README:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	Document show/hide_all behaviour correctly.

2007-08-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-depth.c: Fix typo in the description.

2007-08-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-depth.c: Clarify the depth behaviour
	even more in the description used by the API reference.

2007-08-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-depth.[ch]: Clarify that what drives
	the movement along the Z axis is the ClutterAlpha object (we
	don't have the luxury of a rollover like the opacity does);
	so, if you want to go from 0 to -100 you have to use a
	decreasing function, just as well if you want to go from 100
	to 0. Using a min-depth of 100 and a max-depth of 0 and an
	increasing function is undefined behaviour.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-depth.c: Add a test case for the depth behaviour.

2007-08-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c (clutter_actor_set_opacity): Queue
	a redraw when setting the opacity of an actor.

2007-08-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_get_angle_tilt): Avoid recursion
	by fixing a typo.

	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_get_angle_begin),
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_get_angle_end): Correct the angles
	here too.

2007-08-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_get_property): Do not forget to
	correct the angles when returning them.

2007-08-03  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.h:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_new):
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_newx):

	Added direction parameter; made behaviour to respect direction
	parameter; unclumped angle_begin and angle_end values.

2007-08-02  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* NEWS:
	* README:
	Initial updating ready for release.

2007-08-02  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/eglnative/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:
	* clutter/sdl/clutter-backend-sdl.c: Set the default resolution
	as 96.0 dpi for every backend (we already were under this
	assumption anyway, and this makes it easier to change this
	setting per-backend).

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-fontmap.c:
	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter.h: Allow setting the resolution
	for the PangoClutterFontMap object and provide the implementation
	for the PangoFcFontMap::get_resolution() virtual function. This
	allows to set the resolution of the PangoContext when retrieving
	it.

	* clutter/clutter-label.c (clutter_label_init): Set the
	resolution of the font map with the one the backend gives us.

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c (clutter_entry_init): Ditto.

2007-08-02  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.c (clutter_color_subtract): Invert the
	operands and match what the function says it does. (#435)

2007-08-01  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.c: (clutter_color_from_pixel):
	Fix typo in alpha channel extraction (#434)

2007-08-01  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.[ch]: Add floating-point variant of the
	clutter_actor_get_r[xyz]angx() functions.

2007-07-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.[ch]: Fix clutter_stage_set_user_resizable()
	name, and add a getter for the property.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c: Use the accessor, not
	g_object_get() to retrieve the value of the resizable property.

2007-07-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-backend.[ch]: Add clutter_backend_set_resolution()
	and clutter_backend_get_resolution(); backends should use the former
	to set the resolution of the display when initialising, while actors
	should use the latter when sizing themselves depending on the
	resolution or the font size.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-backend-glx.c: Set the resolution as 96 dpi
	as a default and query the X server when opening the display.

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c: Drop the hardcoded dpi value and use
	clutter_backend_get_resolution() to compute the default size.

2007-07-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c (clutter_entry_init): Set the default
	size of the entry based on the size of the default font. (#414).

2007-07-31  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/sdl/clutter-backend-sdl.c: Fix a typo in
	clutter_backend_sdl_get_features() (#426, Pan Bohui)

2007-07-30  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* AUTHORS:
	* HACKING:
	* README:
	Various updates and improvements.

2007-07-30  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse:
	(clutter_behaviour_ellipse_advance):

	Fixed invalid assumption about z cooordiance in calculation of
	tilt in y axis.

2007-07-30  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	Fix re-relisation for large tiled textures.
	* tests/test-textures.c: (main):
	Add a show/hide to trigger above (see #442)

2007-07-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Document ClutterGravity enumeration
	and remove the only incomplete symbol of the api reference. Now
	we are up to 79% documented symbols.

2007-07-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-media.c: Document ClutterMedia signals;
	replace the implementation of clutter_media_set_filename() with
	something a wee bit more robust (and portable) than a sprintf().

2007-07-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c: Documentation
	fixes; kill some indirections; freeze the notification
	queue when (potentially) emitting multiple notify
	signals.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h: Remove the unused macro
	CLUTTER_TYPE_SMOOTHSTEP.

2007-07-28  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.[ch]: Use GInitiallyUnowned
	as the parent structure in the ClutterActor structure
	definition; somehow, this has escaped everyone attention
	in one year and a half. Luckily, GInitiallyUnowned is
	as big as GObject.

	 (clutter_actor_get_abs_position_units),
	 (clutter_actor_get_abs_position): Check parameters.

	 * clutter/clutter-texture.h: Unmangle the flags enum
	 type declaration, so that dumb parsers like h2defs.py
	 are not fooled.

	 * clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.[ch]:
	 * clutter/clutter-effect.c: Fix some documentation
	 issues and make gtk-doc happy.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-event.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.h:
	* clutter/clutter-types.h: Add missing documentation and fix

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-ellipse.c:
	* tests/test-behave.c:

	Removed tilt paramter from ClutterBehaviourEllipse constructors;
	Made angles to be relative to 12 o'clock;
	Added direction property;

2007-07-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-types.h:
	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add a header for common types, to avoid

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.h: Move some boxed types and som
	enums to clutter-types.h.

2007-07-26  Neil J. Patel  <njp@o-hand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-entry.c: (offset_to_bytes),
	(clutter_entry_ensure_cursor_position),
	(clutter_entry_new_with_text), (clutter_entry_new),
	(clutter_entry_insert_unichar), (clutter_entry_delete_chars):

	Fixed utf8 support so it actually works now, for both
	inserting and deleting chars.  Fixed positioning of cursor for
	utf8 chars. Both GString and Pnago need bytes (not
	documented!) for string manipulation, so making sure all
	values were bytes and not char positions fixed the issue.  Set
	a default size of 50x50 for the entry, otherwise no chars can
	be seen if the size is not set after creation (which confuses
	the developer).

2007-07-26  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c:
	Do not accept zero as a value for the num-frames and fps properties
	in both the constructor and the setter functions.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Rename clutter_behaviour_clear()

2007-07-25  Tomas Frydrych  <tf@openedhand.com>

	* tests/test-rotate.c:
	* tests/Makefile.am:

	Added test-rotate.

2007-07-25  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-bspline.c: Kill off some deep pointer
	indirections; use CLUTTER_NOTE() instead of ifdeffed out g_debug();
	add checks in every public entry point; move some initialisations
	of private data structures out of the constructor and into the
	init function, where they belong.

2007-07-25  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-rotate.h:

	clutter_behaviour_get_actors() to avoid copying list.
	Call fixed point rotation funcs internally.

	* clutter/clutter-effect.c:

	* clutter/eglx/clutter-backend-egl.c:

	eventually allow clutter applications to be run on both GL and GL/ES
	with just a recompile as well as provide more debugging and potentially
	profiling information for GL and GL/ES usage.

	This commit contains the initial GL implementation.

	protocol handling on the main stage window.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Handle CLUTTER_DELETE events internally,
	by calling clutter_main_quit(), and remove the ::delete-event
	signal from ClutterStage; clean up the signal emission sequence
	for the events: emit the ::event signal before emitting any signal
	and the ::event-after signal after the signal has been emitted; move
	the signal emission calls inside ClutterStage so we can call
	g_signal_emit() instead of g_signal_emit_by_name(), thus sparing us
	a lookup for each event.

	* examples/test.c: Remove ::delete-event signal handling.

	ClientMessage events.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-stage-glx.c: Use XSetWMProtocols to enable
	the WM_PROTOCOLS ClientMessage events on the stage window.

	* clutter/glx/clutter-glx.h: Return the Screen pointer and not
	the screen number in clutter_glx_get_default_screen(). The screen
	number is returned by clutter_backend_get_screen_number(), or
	by calling XScreenNumberOfScreen on the returned pointer.

	* clutter/clutter-event.h: Add CLUTTER_DELETE to the event types.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Emit the ClutterStage::delete-event

	* clutter/clutter-event.h:
	* clutter/glx/clutter-event-glx.c: Add the XEMBED protocol support
	in the GLX backend, for embedding the stage window into another
	X window. This allows cross-toolkit inclusion and makes clutter-gtk

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Implement every ClutterGravity
	value inside the scale behaviour and make the actors anchor to a
	gravity when scaling up and down.

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Revert to copying GdkPixbuf areas to
	correctly implement the texture tiling. This fixes segmentation
	faults occurring with cards with a small texture memory area.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Call g_object_freeze_notify() (and take
	a reference on the actor) inside clutter_actor_request_size() so

	the function.

	* clutter/clutter-fixed.c: Fix gtk-doc.

	switch controlling the VBlank method to be used: it overrides

2006-12-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_to_string(),

2006-12-20  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* NEWS:
	Add some missing improvements.

2006-12-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c: Remove some gtk-isms; always take
	a reference before calling g_object_notify(), as the object
	might get disposed while calling the closures inside the
	notify queue; notify the changes of the ellipsize property.

2006-12-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Expose clutter_color_copy()

2006-12-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_equal(),
	a function for comparing two colors.

2006-12-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-event.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Update the inline apidoc.

2006-12-13  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: (clutter_actor_class_init):
	Allow actor x,y props to be negative.

2006-12-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Rework part of the show/hide machinery.  Allow groups sub-classes
	and composite actors to override show_all/hide_all in order to
	decide which children they wish to show/hide.  This means that
	if an actor overrides the default show/hide virtual methods, it'll
	have to chain up to the parent class show/hide.  While we're at it,
	provide the fully recursive clutter_actor_show_all() and
	clutter_actor_hide_all() methods.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add apidoc for the ClutterKnot
	functions; add pathological equality case for clutter_knot_equal().

	* clutter/clutter-event.h:
	* clutter/clutter-feature.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c:Fix parameters name so that
	gtk-doc doesn't complain.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-event.c: Add apidoc

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Add a clutter_actor_show_all() and a
	clutter_actor_hide_all() functions; provide a mechanism for
	groups and composited actors to programmatically select what to
	show/hide when clutter_actor_show_all() and clutter_actor_hide_all()
	are called.  If you are overriding the ClutterActor::show or
	the ClutterActor::hide virtual methods you should chain up with
	the parent class.

	* clutter/clutter-group.c: Override show_all and hide_all and
	recursively show/hide every child inside the group;
	clutter_group_show_all() and clutter_group_hide_all() remain as non
	recursive versions of clutter_actor_show_all() and
	clutter_actor_hide_all() (maybe we should rename them in order
	to avoid name clashes with the bindings).

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Chain up with parent class show
	and hide vfuncs.

	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.h:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c: Provide API for changing the
	parent texture of a clone texture actor.

	* examples/behave.c:
	* examples/super-oh.c:
	* examples/test.c: Use clutter_actor_show_all() instead of
	clutter_group_show_all().

2006-12-08  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.doap:
	Put release date in correct format.

2006-12-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h: Add a function prototype
	for the foreach function: we need something more specific
	than GFunc; add clutter_behaviour_get_actors(), used to
	get a list of the actors.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Add debugging notes; add
	a warning for behaviour implementations missing the
	alpha_notify vfunc; add api documentation

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Reimplement the
	alpha_notify functions using the new foreach function
	and, where possible, by directly iterating on the
	actors: this shaves off the number of recalculations
	of the property/alpha values, and the number of
	functions.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: Forgot to set the
	pencil color.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* behave.c: Add test for clutter_color_parse().

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-event.c: Move the apidoc out.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_parse(),
	which parses a string containing a color definition as
	understood by XParseColor() (or pango_color_parse()).

2006-12-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Avoid clutter segfaulting when used without invoking
	clutter_init().  This is needed when using api documentation
	tools and every other tool relying on the GObject
	introspection API (esp. on a headless box).  see the
	note in clutter/clutter-feature.c:clutter_feature_init
	for a full explanation.

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c: Call clutter_feature_init()
	when needed by one of the accessors of the features
	structure.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Remove clutter_feature_init()
	public declaration: the features support check is done the
	first time a feature is needed.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Do not ever access the clutter
	main context pointer directly; instead, obtain a pointer
	to it via clutter_context_get_default(), which will always
	return something valid.

2006-12-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Add our own READABLE,
	WRITABLE and READWRITE paramspec flags, declaring the
	string components of the properties GParamSpec as static;
	this should shave off some bytes in the memory footprint
	and avoid relocations.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behavuour-scale.c:

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Use the CLUTTER_PARAM_*
	macros we just added.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Add properties for
	the scale begin, scale end and gravity parameters.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h: Mark the ClutterKnot
	memory management functions as public (for the bindings),
	since we use the slice allocator for copying knots around;
	add a clutter_knot_equal() function.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	(node_distance): Use clutter_knot_equal() as a fast path
	to avoid the sqrt() in case the nodes we are using are
	at the same position.
	(path_total_length): Additional check on the existence
	of the next node.

	* examples/behave.c: Do not leak the ClutterBehaviour
	objects around.

2006-12-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.h: Clean up.

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Typo fix in the name
	of ClutterTextureTileDimension.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Allow passing NULL
	to clutter_behaviour_set_alpha() (as we pass NULL
	in the finalize process).

2006-12-02  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Fix a stupid logic
	error in the CHECK_VERSION macro.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_swap_buffers): Remove, as the same is done
	via clutter_redraw() and clutter_actor_queue_redraw().

	(clutter_stage_unrealize), (clutter_stage_init),
	(clutter_stage_set_xwindow_foreign): Do not call
	XDestroyWindow() on the stage Window if we are using a
	foreign Window, as we don't control its lifetime.

2006-11-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove the gtk directory from the SUBDIRS.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: Add clutter_stage_swap_buffers(),

	* gtk/*
	* configure.ac:
	* Makfile.am: Remove the GTK+ widget from the
	main tree; now Clutter depends just on GLib,
	XLibs, GdkPixbuf and OpenGL.

2006-11-29  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: (clutter_stage_realize):
	Set colormap on stage window - should fix issues
	with indirect rendering.

2006-11-23  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	Fix small macro typo.

2006-11-22  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c:
	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	Make CLUTTER_NOTE() just take a string rather than a func.
	Add more default context to output.

	* configure.ac:
	Fix flag and add more help docs for --ebable-debug option.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add a --g-fatal-warnings switch
	for abort()-ing on warnings and criticals.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Enable debug messages also when
	--enable-debug is set to "minimum".

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter-debug.h: Move all debugging macros inside
	this private header; make all debug macros depend on the
	CLUTTER_ENABLE_DEBUG compile time define, controlled by
	the --enable-debug configure switch; add G_LOG_DOMAIN define.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Clean up the debug stuff; add
	command line argument parsing using GOption; the debug
	messages now are triggered like this:

	  CLUTTER_DEBUG=section:section:... clutter-app

	or like this:

	  clutter-app --clutter-debug=section:section:...

	where "section" is one of the sections listed in clutter-main.c,
	or "all", for all sections; each section is bound to a flag,
	which can be used to define a domain when adding a debug note
	using the CLUTTER_NOTE() macro; the old CLUTTER_DBG() macro is
	just a wrapper around that, under the CLUTTER_DEBUG_MISC domain;
	CLUTTER_NOTE() is used like this:

	  CLUTTER_NOTE (DOMAIN, log-function);

	where log function is g_printerr(), g_message(), g_warning(),
	g_critical() or directly g_log() - for instance:

	  CLUTTER_NOTE (PANGO, g_warning ("Cache miss: %d", glyph));

	will print the warning only if the "pango" flag has been
	set to the CLUTTER_DEBUG envvar or passed to the --clutter-debug
	command line argument.

	similar to CLUTTER_SHOW_FPS, there's also the --clutter-show-fps
	command line switch; also, the --display and --screen command
	line switches have been added: the first overrides the DISPLAY
	envvar and the second controls the X screen used by Clutter to
	get the root window on the display.

	* clutter/clutter-main.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add extended support for GOption
	in Clutter; use clutter_init_with_args() to let Clutter
	parse your own command line arguments; use instead
	clutter_get_option_group() to get the GOptionGroup used by
	Clutter if you want to do the parsing yourself with
	g_option_context_parse(). The init sequence has been verified,
	updated and moved into common functions where possible.

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c:
	* clutter/*.c: Include "clutter-debug.h" where needed; use
	CLUTTER_NOTE() instead of CLUTTER_DBG().

	* examples/super-oh.c: Use the new clutter_init_with_args()
	function, and add a --num-hands command line switch to
	the SuperOH example code controlling the number of hands at
	runtime.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Rename G_ENABLE_DEBUG to CLUTTER_ENABLE_DEBUG.

2006-11-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.h:
	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: Add border to the ClutterRectangle
	actor; add "border-width", "border-color" and "has-border"
	properties, plus their accessors.  The border generation code is
	pretty lame, at the moment.

	* examples/behave.c: Add code to test the new rectangle properties.

2006-11-20  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.doap:
	Add an initial DOAP file to project

2006-11-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h:
	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Auto-generated versioning macros.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Add a ClutterActor::parent-set signal,
	for notificating changes of an actor's parent; add api-doc for
	the actor's properties; add the ClutterActor "name" property; clean
	up a bit some functions; emit the "parent-set" signal when setting
	te parent and when unparenting; better warnings when lowering
	and raising an actor.

	* configure.ac:
	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add a --enable-debug configure option,
	with three levels of debugging: no, minimum and yes; default
	for development releases (odd minor version) is "yes"; update
	the version m4 defines; update the libtool macros: now just
	changed the clutter_interface_age when releasing will update
	everything else.

2006-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add "since" strings; add
	a "knot" property which can be used to append a knot to the path;
	fix apidoc.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Add "since" strings.

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c: Add apidoc.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c: Add the "opacity-start"
	and "opacity-end" properties; rewrite constructor to use them.

2006-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add a "knot-reached" signal,
	which is emitted when the path reaches a node in the nodes list;
	flesh out the documentation a bit; sync the parameters names
	so that gtk-doc doesn't complain about missing stuff.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Add the alpha value to the
	ClutterBehaviour::alpha_notify vfunc, so you don't have to
	get the value from the alpha inside the behaviour implementations;
	add more documentation.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Flesh out the description.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h: Update the header.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Update docs.

2006-11-17  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	More docs.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	More docs, add clutter_behaviour_path_insert_knot(),
	clutter_behaviour_path_remove_knot()

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c:
	More docs, add clutter_behaviour_scale_newx() taking fixed values.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h:
	Add clutter alpha sine func

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.c:

	* examples/behave.c: (main):
	More playing with new behaviour functionality

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c:
	* clutter/clutter-feature.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	Add new experimental sync to vblank code
	Set env CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable.

2006-11-16  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Implement the defined
	clutter_actor_reparent() method; call unrealize
	when unparenting an actor.

2006-11-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h:
	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Add a data parameter to
	the ClutterAlphaFunc; add a data+destroy parameter
	to clutter_alpha_set_func() and to clutter_alpha_new(),
	and turned the latter into clutter_alpha_new_full();
	add a simple, empty constructor clutter_alpha_new().

	These changes makes writing bindings a tad more easy,
	as bindings require passing their own functions in
	order to call the real alpha function.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h: Clean up the header.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.[ch]: Split the
	ClutterBehaviourPath, ClutterBehaviourOpacity and
	ClutterBehaviourScale into their own files as they
	have been growing a bit. Fix ClutterBehaviourPath
	API.

	* clutter/clutter-media.h: Remove the commented
	"metadata_available" signal: gtk-doc chokes up on that.

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.h:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Remove the useless
	ClutterTimelineAlphaFunc signature; add missing accessor
	methods for the properties; clean up a bit.

	* clutter/clutter-util.h:
	* clutter/clutter-util.c: Remove unneeded function
	clutter_util_can_create_texture().

	* clutter/clutter-feature.h: Sync the name of
	clutter_feature_get_all() with the name declared
	in clutter-feature.h.

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h: Update.

	* examples/behave.c: Update to the new ClutterAlpha
	constructor.

	* examples/super-oh.c: Use the right pointer and avoid
	the compiler making a fuss about it.

2006-11-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h:
	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: ClutterAlpha is an initially
	floating object, as it makes sense only when bound to
	a ClutterBehaviour; add checks for public API.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Remove the ClutterBehaviour
	constructor: ClutterBehaviour is an abstract class which
	must be implemented by subclassing; add checks for public
	API; unref the actors on finalize; sink the ClutterAlpha
	object.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.h: ClutterKnot is a boxed
	type: add the _get_type() function declaration and the
	type macro.

	Big rework of the actor management semantics: now ClutterActor
	objects behave like GtkObjects - that is they have an initial
	"floating" reference that gets "sunk" when they are added to
	a ClutterGroup.  This makes a group responsible of de-allocating
	each actor inside it, so you just have to destroy the group to
	get every child actor destroyed.  Also, now you can do:

	  clutter_group_add (group, clutter_video_texture_new ());

	without having to care about reference counting and explicit
	unreffing.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Add private flags setter and
	getter macros.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Clean up; inherit from GInitiallyUnowned;
	add a "visible" property; add the "destroy", "show" and "hide"
	signals to ClutterActorClass.

	(clutter_actor_show), (clutter_actor_hide): Refactor a bit; emit
	the "show" and "hide" signals.

	(clutter_actor_set_property), (clutter_actor_get_property),
	(clutter_actor_class_init): Implement the "visible" property; add
	signals.

	(clutter_actor_finalize): Do not leak the actor's name, if it is
	set.

	(clutter_actor_dispose): Emit the "destroy" signal here.

	(clutter_actor_init): Sink the initial floating flag if needed.

	(clutter_actor_destroy): Add a function to explicitely destroy
	a ClutterActor.

	(clutter_actor_set_parent), (clutter_actor_get_parent),
	(clutter_actor_unparent): Make set_parent require a valid parent;
	add unparent; check on get_parent; ref_sink the actor when
	setting its parent and unref it when unsetting it.  Probably we'll
	need a function that does reparenting as unparent+set_parent in
	a single shot.

	* clutter/clutter-group.h:
	* clutter/clutter-group.c (clutter_group_dispose),
	(clutter_group_finalize), (clutter_group_add),
	(clutter_group_remove): Make the group destroy its children when
	disposing it; clean up, and use the newly-available
	clutter_actor_unparent().

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_init): ClutterStage is
	a top-level actor; clean up.

	* clutter/clutter-video-texture.h:
	* clutter/clutter-video-texture.c: Clean up.

	* examples/super-oh.c:
	* examples/test.c:
	* examples/video-player.c:
	* examples/test-text.c:
	* examples/video-cube.c: Remove the g_object_unref() call, as the
	ClutterStage object is destroyed on clutter_main_quit().
