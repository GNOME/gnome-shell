      org.gnome.Shell.SearchProvider2:
      @short_description: Search provider interface

      The interface used for integrating into GNOME Shell's search
      interface (version 2).
  -->
  <interface name="org.gnome.Shell.SearchProvider2">

    <!--
        GetInitialResultSet:
        @terms: Array of search terms, which the provider should treat as logical AND.
        @results: An array of result identifier strings representing items which match the given search terms. Identifiers must be unique within the provider's domain, but other than that may be chosen freely by the provider.

        Called when the user first begins a search.
    -->
    <method name="GetInitialResultSet">
      <arg type="as" name="terms" direction="in" />
      <arg type="as" name="results" direction="out" />

    <!--
        GetSubsearchResultSet:
        @previous_results: Array of results previously returned by GetInitialResultSet().
        @terms: Array of updated search terms, which the provider should treat as logical AND.
        @results: An array of result identifier strings representing items which match the given search terms. Identifiers must be unique within the provider's domain, but other than that may be chosen freely by the provider.

        Called when a search is performed which is a "subsearch" of
        the previous search, e.g. the method may return less results, but
        not more or different results.

        This allows search providers to only search through the previous
        result set, rather than possibly performing a full re-query.

        GetResultMetas:
        @identifiers: An array of result identifiers as returned by GetInitialResultSet() or GetSubsearchResultSet()
        @metas: A dictionary describing the given search result, containing a human-readable 'name' (string), along with the result identifier this meta is for, 'id' (string). Optionally, 'icon' (a serialized GIcon as obtained by g_icon_serialize) can be specified if the result can be better served with a thumbnail of the content (such as with images). 'gicon' (a serialized GIcon as obtained by g_icon_to_string) or 'icon-data' (raw image data as (iiibiiay) - width, height, rowstride, has-alpha, bits per sample, channels, data) are deprecated values that can also be used for that purpose. A 'description' field (string) may also be specified if more context would help the user find the desired result.

        Return an array of meta data used to display each given result

        @terms: Array of search terms, which the provider should treat as logical AND.
        @timestamp: A timestamp of the user interaction that triggered this call

        Called when the users chooses a given result. The result should
        be displayed in the application associated with the corresponding
        provider. The provided search terms can be used to allow launching a full search in
        the application.
