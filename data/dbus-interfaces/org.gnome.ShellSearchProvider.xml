      org.gnome.Shell.SearchProvider:
      @short_description: Search provider interface

      The interface used for integrating into GNOME Shell's search
      interface. This interface is deprecated, and org.gnome.Shell.SearchProvider2 should be used instead.

    <!--
        GetInitialResultSet:
        @terms: Array of search terms, which the provider should treat as logical AND.
        @results: An array of result identifier strings representing items which match the given search terms. Identifiers must be unique within the provider's domain, but other than that may be chosen freely by the provider.

        Called when the user first begins a search.

        GetSubsearchResultSet:
        @previous_results: Array of results previously returned by GetInitialResultSet().
        @terms: Array of updated search terms, which the provider should treat as logical AND.
        @results: An array of result identifier strings representing items which match the given search terms. Identifiers must be unique within the provider's domain, but other than that may be chosen freely by the provider.

        Called when a search is performed which is a "subsearch" of
        the previous search, e.g. the method may return less results, but
        not more or different results.

        This allows search providers to only search through the previous
        result set, rather than possibly performing a full re-query.

        GetResultMetas:
        @identifiers: An array of result identifiers as returned by GetInitialResultSet() or GetSubsearchResultSet()
        @metas: A dictionary describing the given search result, containing a human-readable 'name' (string), along with the result identifier this meta is for, 'id' (string). Optionally, either 'gicon' (a serialized GIcon) or 'icon-data' (raw image data as (iiibiiay) - width, height, rowstride, has-alpha, bits per sample, channels, data) can be specified if the result can be better served with a thumbnail of the content (such as with images). A 'description' field (string) may also be specified if more context would help the user find the desired result.

        Return an array of meta data used to display each given result

        Called when the users chooses a given result. The result should
        be displayed in the application associated with the corresponding
        provider.

        This method is deprecated, and providers should implement ActivateResult2()
        instead.
