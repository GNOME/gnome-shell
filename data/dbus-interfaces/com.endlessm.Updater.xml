    com.endlessm.Updater:
    @short_description: Endless OS updater control interface

    Interface to query the state of the OS updater, and to control it: checking
    for, downloading and applying updates.

    The updater moves through a series of states (see the `State` property and
    `StateChanged` signal), with state transitions triggered by the appropriate
    method call, or by an error in an operation. It will return a
    `com.endlessm.Updater.Error.WrongState` error if you attempt to perform an
    invalid state transition.
  -->
  <interface name="com.endlessm.Updater">
    <!--
      Poll:

      Check for updates. This may be performed from the `Ready`,
      `UpdateAvailable`, `UpdateReady` or `Error` states. It will immediately
      transition to the `Polling` state. If an update is then successfully
      found, it will transition to the `UpdateAvailable` state. If no update is
      available, it will transition to the `Ready` state. If there is an error
      checking for an update, it will transition to the `Error` state.

      If an update is found, its details will be reported through the updater’s
      properties once the updater reaches the `UpdateAvailable` state. In
      particular, through the `UpdateID`, `UpdateRefspec`, `UpdateLabel` and
      `UpdateMessage` properties.
    -->
    <method name="Poll"></method>

    <!--
      PollVolume:
      @path: Absolute path to the root directory of a volume to check.

      Like `Poll`, except this polls a specific removable volume (such as a USB
      stick), rather than the internet.

      If a `.ostree/repo` directory is available beneath @path, and it contains
      a valid OSTree repository, that repository will be checked for updates.
      If no such directory exists, the updater will transition to state `Ready`
      as no update is available.
    -->
    <method name="PollVolume">
      <arg name="path" type="s" direction="in"/>
    </method>

    <!--
      Fetch:

      Download an update. This may be performed from the `UpdateAvailable` state
      only. It will immediately transition to the `Fetching` state. If the
      update is successfully downloaded, it will transition to the `UpdateReady`
      state; if there was an error it will transition to `Error`.

      Download progress will be reported through the updater’s properties; in
      particular, `DownloadedBytes`.
    -->
    <method name="Fetch"></method>

    <!--
      FetchFull:
      @options: Potentially empty dictionary of options.

      Like `Fetch`, except options may be provided to affect its behaviour.
      Currently, the following options are supported (unsupported options are
      ignored):

        * `force` (type: `b`): If true, force the download without scheduling
          it through the system’s metered data scheduler. Typically, this would
          be true in response to an explicit user action, and false otherwise.
        * `scheduling-timeout-seconds` (type: `u`): Number of seconds to wait
          for permission to download from the system’s metered data scheduler,
          before returning a `com.endlessm.Updater.Error.MeteredConnection`
          error and cancelling the download. Pass zero to disable the timeout.
    -->
    <method name="FetchFull">
      <arg name="options" type="a{sv}" direction="in"/>
    </method>

    <!--
      Apply:

      Apply a downloaded update so that it’s available to boot into on the next
      boot. This may be performed from the `UpdateReady` state only. It will
      immediately transition to the `Applying` state. If the update is
      successfully applied, it will transition to the `UpdateApplied` state; if
      there was an error it will transition to `Error`.
    -->
    <method name="Apply"></method>

    <!--
      Cancel:

      Cancel the ongoing poll, fetch or apply operation. This may be performed
      from the `Polling`, `Fetching` or `ApplyingUpdate` states. It will cancel
      the operation then transition to the `Error` state, with the error
      `com.endlessm.Updater.Error.Cancelled`.
    -->
    <method name="Cancel"></method>

    <!--
      State:

      Current state of the updater. This will be one of the following:

        * `0` (`None`): No state.
        * `1` (`Ready`): Ready to perform an action.
        * `2` (`Error`): An error occurred. See the `ErrorName` and
          `ErrorMessage` properties for details.
        * `3` (`Polling`): Checking for updates.
        * `4` (`UpdateAvailable`): An update is available. See the `UpdateID`,
          `UpdateRefspec`, `UpdateLabel` and `UpdateMessage` properties for
          details.
        * `5` (`Fetching`): Downloading an update. See the `DownloadedBytes`
          property for progress updates.
        * `6` (`UpdateReady`): Update downloaded and ready to apply.
        * `7` (`ApplyingUpdate`): Applying an update.
        * `8` (`UpdateApplied`): Update applied and ready to reboot into.

      State changes are notified using the `StateChanged` signal.
