      net.hadess.SwitcherooControl:
      @short_description: D-Bus proxy to access dual-GPU controls.

      After checking the availability of two switchable GPUs in the machine,
      check the value of net.hadess.SwitcherooControl.HasDualGpu to see
      if running applications on the discrete GPU should be offered.

      The object path will be "/net/hadess/SwitcherooControl".
