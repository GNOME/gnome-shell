// Endless-specific overrides and definitions
//
// All the definitions here will be processed AFTER _common.scss and other SASS
// source files, meaning that they will override the relevant rules in the
// generated CSS files, just as doing it in "raw" CSS would do.
//
// However, be aware that overriding here the values of SASS variables defined in
// those other files won't override the end result for rules already declared in
// those files as well, which will still be using the original value as they are
// pre-processed before _endless.css. In those cases, modifying those files directly
// is probably the best way forward (e.g. modifying _common.css for $font-family)).
