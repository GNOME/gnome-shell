<!--
Please read https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/tree/main#reporting-bugs
first to ensure that you create a clear and specific issue.
-->

### Affected version

<!--
Provide at least the following information:
* Your OS and version
* Affected GNOME Shell version (see https://release.gnome.org/calendar/
  for currently supported versions)
* Does this issue appear in XOrg and/or Wayland
* Does this issue happen without extensions (please follow instructions below)

To properly disable extensions you can use gnome-extensions-app and then restart
your session. Disabling extensions without a restart is not sufficient to rule
out extensions as cause of a bug. If an issue can only be reproduced with a
certain extension, please file a bug report against that extension first.
