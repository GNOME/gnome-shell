      org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig:
      @short_description: display configuration interface

      This interface is used by mutter and gnome-settings-daemon
      to apply multiple monitor configuration.

  <interface name="org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig">

    <!--
        GetResources:
	@serial: configuration serial
	@crtcs: available CRTCs
	@outputs: available outputs
	@modes: available modes

        Retrieves the current layout of the hardware.

        @serial is an unique identifier representing the current state
        of the screen. It must be passed back to ApplyConfiguration()
	and will be increased for every configuration change (so that
	mutter can detect that the new configuration is based on old
	state).

	A CRTC (CRT controller) is a logical monitor, ie a portion
	of the compositor coordinate space. It might correspond
	to multiple monitors, when in clone mode, but not that
	it is possible to implement clone mode also by setting different
	CRTCs to the same coordinates.

	The number of CRTCs represent the maximum number of monitors
	that can be set to expand and it is a HW constraint; if more
	monitors are connected,	then necessarily some will clone. This
	is complementary to the concept of the encoder (not exposed in
	the API), which groups outputs that necessarily will show the
	same image (again a HW constraint).

	A CRTC is represented by a DBus structure with the following
	layout:
	* u ID: the ID in the API of this CRTC
	* x winsys_id: the low-level ID of this CRTC (which might
	               be a XID, a KMS handle or something entirely
		       different)
	* i x, y, width, height: the geometry of this CRTC
	                         (might be invalid if the CRTC is not in
				 use)
	* i current_mode: the current mode of the CRTC, or -1 if this
	                  CRTC is not used
			  Note: the size of the mode will always correspond
			  to the width and height of the CRTC
	* u current_transform: the current transform (espressed according
	                       to the wayland protocol)
	* au transforms: all possible transforms
	* a{sv} properties: other high-level properties that affect this
	                    CRTC; they are not necessarily reflected in
			    the hardware.
			    No property is specified in this version of the API.
        FIXME: gamma?

        Note: all geometry information refers to the untransformed
	display.

	An output represents a physical screen, connected somewhere to
	the computer. Floating connectors are not exposed in the API.
	An output is a DBus struct with the following fields:
	* u ID: the ID in the API
	* x winsys_id: the low-level ID of this output (XID or KMS handle)
	* i current_crtc: the CRTC that is currently driving this output,
	                  or -1 if the output is disabled
	* au possible_crtcs: all CRTCs that can control this output
	* s name: the name of the connector to which the output is attached
	          (like VGA1 or HDMI)
	* au modes: valid modes for this output
	* a{sv} properties: other high-level properties that affect this
	                    output; they are not necessarily reflected in
			    the hardware.
			    Known properties:
                            - "vendor" (s): (readonly) the human readable name
                                            of the manufacturer
                            - "product" (s): (readonly) the human readable name
                                             of the display model
                            - "serial" (s): (readonly) the serial number of this
                                            particular hardware part
			    - "display-name" (s): (readonly) a human readable name
			                          of this output, to be shown in the UI
			    - "primary" (b): whether this output is primary
			                     or not
			    - "presentation" (b): whether this output is
			                          for presentation only
			    Note: properties might be ignored if not consistenly
			    applied to all outputs in the same clone group. In
			    general, it's expected that presentation or primary
			    outputs will not be cloned.

        A mode represents a set of parameters that are applied to
	each output, such as resolution and refresh rate. It is a separate
	object so that it can be referenced by CRTCs and outputs.
	Multiple outputs in the same CRTCs must all have the same mode.
	A mode is exposed as:
	* u ID: the ID in the API
	* x winsys_id: the low-level ID of this mode
	* u width, height: the resolution
	* d frequency: refresh rate

        Output and modes are read-only objects (except for output properties),
	they can change only in accordance to HW changes (such as hotplugging
	a monitor), while CRTCs can be changed with ApplyConfiguration().

        XXX: actually, if you insist enough, you can add new modes
	through xrandr command line or the KMS API, overriding what the
	kernel driver and the EDID say.
	Usually, it only matters with old cards with broken drivers, or
	old monitors with broken EDIDs, but it happens more often with
	projectors (if for example the kernel driver doesn't add the
	640x480 - 800x600 - 1024x768 default modes). Probably something
	that we need to handle in mutter anyway.

        ApplyConfiguration:
	@serial: configuration serial
	@persistent: whether this configuration should be saved on disk
	@crtcs: new data for CRTCs
	@outputs: new data for outputs

	Applies the requested configuration changes.

	@serial must match the serial from the last GetResources() call,
	or org.freedesktop.DBus.AccessDenied will be generated.

	If @persistent is true, mutter will attempt to replicate this
	configuration the next time this HW layout appears.

	@crtcs represents the new logical configuration, as a list
	of structures containing:
	- u ID: the API ID from the corresponding GetResources() call
	- i new_mode: the API ID of the new mode to configure the CRTC
	              with, or -1 if the CRTC should be disabled
        - i x, y: the new coordinates of the top left corner
	          the geometry will be completed with the size information
		  from @new_mode
	- au outputs: the API ID of outputs that should be assigned to
	              this CRTC
        - a{sv} properties: properties whose value should be changed

	Note: CRTCs not referenced in the array will be	disabled.

	@outputs represent the output property changes as:
	- u ID: the API ID of the output to change
	- a{sv} properties: properties whose value should be changed

	Note: both for CRTCs and outputs, properties not included in
	the dictionary will not be changed.

	Note: unrecognized properties will have no effect, but if the
	configuration change succeeds the property will be reported
	by the next GetResources() call, and if @persistent is true,
	it will also be saved to disk.

	If the configuration is invalid according to the previous
	GetResources() call, for example because a CRTC references
	an output it cannot drive, or not all outputs support the
	chosen mode, the error org.freedesktop.DBus.InvalidArgs will
	be generated.

	If the configuration cannot be applied for any other reason
	(eg. the screen size would exceed texture limits), the error
	org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.LimitsExceeded will be generated.
