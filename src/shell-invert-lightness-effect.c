 * SECTION:shell-invert-lightness-effect
 * @short_description: A colorization effect where lightness is inverted but
 * color is not.
 * @see_also: #ClutterEffect, #ClutterOffscreenEffect
 *
 * #ShellInvertLightnessEffect is a sub-class of #ClutterEffect that enhances
 * the appearance of a clutter actor.  Specifically it inverts the lightness
 * of a #ClutterActor (e.g., darker colors become lighter, white becomes black,
 * and white, black).
