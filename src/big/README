The Clutter actors and other files in this directory were created by
litl, LLC.  They are released under the terms of the Library General
Public license.

The idea is that these actors may eventually make their way into Clutter
or into other libraries.

litl has requested that these actors should not be publically
installed under the 'big_*' names to avoid conflicts with their
development. So if you use them in your applications, do *NOT*
install:

 - A 'libbig' library
 - The header files
 - gobject-introspection data for these actors

Into public locations. You can of course, take the code and rename it,
as long as you respect the provisions of the LGPL, or install into
private locations as we do for gnome-shell. (We install the typelib
into a private location, link the source files directly into the
gnome-shell plugin so no external library is needed, and we don't
install the header files at all.)
