/**
 * SECTION:clutter-version
 * @short_description: Versioning utility macros
 *
 * Clutter offers a set of macros for checking the version of the library
 * at compile time; it also provides a function to perform the same check
 * at run time.
 *
 * Clutter adds version information to both API deprecations and additions;
 * by definining the macros %CLUTTER_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED and
 * %CLUTTER_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED, you can specify the range of Clutter versions
 * whose API you want to use. Functions that were deprecated before, or
 * introduced after, this range will trigger compiler warnings. For instance,
 * if we define the following symbols:
 *
 * |[
 *   CLUTTER_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = CLUTTER_VERSION_1_6
 *   CLUTTER_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED  = CLUTTER_VERSION_1_8
 * ]|
 *
 * and we have the following functions annotated in the Clutter headers:
 *
 * |[
 *   void clutter_function_A (void) CLUTTER_DEPRECATED_IN_1_4;
 *   void clutter_function_B (void) CLUTTER_DEPRECATED_IN_1_6;
 *   void clutter_function_C (void) CLUTTER_AVAILABLE_IN_1_8;
 *   void clutter_function_D (void) CLUTTER_AVAILABLE_IN_1_10;
 * ]|
 *
 * then any application code using the functions above will get the output:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_function_A: deprecation warning
 *   clutter_function_B: no warning
 *   clutter_function_C: no warning
 *   clutter_function_D: symbol not available warning
 * ]|
 *
 * It is possible to disable the compiler warnings by defining the macro
 * %CLUTTER_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS before including the clutter.h
 * header.
