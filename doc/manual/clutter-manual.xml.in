                                <para>Why do Clutter applications run <emphasis>really</emphasis> slowly on Intel cards even though direct rendering support is reported.</para>
                        </question>
                        <answer>
                                <para>There is a bug in some versions of the Intel drivers that causes the driver to 'stall' when attempting to sync to vblank (as Clutter does by default). The fix is to either upgrade your drivers or set 'CLUTTER_VBLANK=none' when running Clutter applications.</para>
