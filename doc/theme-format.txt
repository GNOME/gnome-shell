Themes are in a simple XML-subset format. There are multiple versions
of the theme format, and a given theme can support more than one format.

Version 1:     THEMEDIR/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml
  (original metacity format)
Version 2:     THEMEDIR/metacity-1/metacity-theme-2.xml
Version 3:     THEMEDIR/metacity-1/metacity-theme-3.xml

The subdirectory name is "metacity-1" in all versions.

As you might expect, older versions of metacity will not understand
newer theme formats. However, newer versions will use old themes.
Metacity will always use the newest theme format it understands that
the X server supports. Some format versions are only supported if you
have the right X server features.

Each format *requires* the corresponding filename. If you put version
2 format features in the metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml file, then
metacity will get angry.

This document has separate sections for each format version. You may
want to read the document in reverse order, since the base features
are discussed under version 1.

New Features in Theme Format Version 3
======================================

Format version 3 has exactly one new feature; any element in the file
can now have a version attribute:

  version="[<|<=|=>|>] MAJOR.MINOR"

(< and > should be to be entity escaped as &lt; and &gt;). If this
version check is not met, then the element and its children will be
ignored. This allows having alternate sections of the theme file for
older and newer version of the Metacity theme format.

When placed on the toplevel <metacity_theme> element, an unsatisfied
version check will not just cause the contents of the file to be
ignored, it will also cause the lookup of a theme file to proceed on
and look for an older format 2 or format 1 file. This allows making a
metacity-theme-3.xml file that is only used the format version 3.2 or
newer is supported, and using metacity-theme-1.xml for older window
managers.

New Features in Theme Format Version 2
======================================

The optional attributes rounded_top_left, rounded_top_right,
rounded_bottom_left and rounded_bottom_right on <frame_geometry>
should now be the radius of the corner in pixels. You may still use
the values "false" for 0 and "true" for 5, which means v1 values will
still work just fine.

<frame_geometry> has a new optional attribute, hide_buttons. If this
is true, no buttons will be displayed on the titlebar.

Anywhere you can use a positive integer, you can use an integer constant.

As well as constant integers and reals, you may define constant colours,
thus:
  <constant name="RevoltingPink" value="#FF00FF"/>
  <constant name="Background" value="gtk:bg[NORMAL]"/>

<frame_style> has two new optional attributes, background and alpha.
If you specify alpha, you must specify background. background is a
colour used for the background of the frame. alpha is the transparency
as a real between 0.0 and 1.0. If the current X server does not support
alpha channels, the value is ignored.

The filename attribute of <image> may begin with "theme:". If so, the
rest of the string is the name of a theme icon. The 64x64 version of the
icon is used, except for fallback mini_icons, which use the 16x16 version.
This does not affect ordinary resizing. For example:
  <button function="close" state="normal">
    <draw_ops>
      <include name="active_button"/>
      <image filename="theme:gnome-logout" x="2" y="2"
          width="width-4" height="height-4"/>
      <!-- Note: not "theme:gnome-logout.png" or similar. -->
    </draw_ops>
  </button>

<menu_icon>s are parsed but ignored.

Fallback icons can be specified using <fallback>. There are two
optional arguments, icon and mini_icon. The values of these arguments
are identical to that of the filename attribute of <image>. Fallback
icons are used when a window does not supply its own icon. If a fallback
icon is not specified with <fallback>, Metacity will use a built-in
icon, as in metacity-theme-1.

The <arc> element, as well as the original start_angle and end_angle
attributes, may be given from and to attributes. The values of these
attributes are given in degrees clockwise, with 0 being straight up.
For example:
  <arc from="0.0" to="90.0" filled="true" color="#FF00FF"
      x="0" y="5" width="15" height="15"/>

<frame state="shaded"> may now take an optional resize attribute, with
the same interpretation as the resize attribute on <frame state="normal">.
If this attribute is omitted for state="shaded", it defaults to "both".
(If it is omitted for state="normal", it remains an error.)

In addition to the four <button> functions which are required in
metacity-theme-1, there are six new functions in metacity-theme-2:
shade, unshade, above, unabove, stick and unstick.

<constant name="LineOffset" value="3"/>

<!-- define drawing operations to be referenced later; 
     these draw-op lists can also be placed inline. 

     Positions/lengths are given as expressions.
     Operators are: +,-,*,/,%,`max`,`min`
     All operators are infix including `max` and `min`, 
      i.e. "2 `max` 5"
     
     Some variables are predefined, and constants can also 
     be used. Variables are:

       width - width of target area
       height - height of target area
       object_width - natural width of object being drawn
       object_height - natural height of object being drawn
       left_width - distance from left of frame to client window
       right_width - distance from right of frame to client window
       top_height - distance from top of frame to client window
       bottom_height - distance from bottom of frame to client window
       mini_icon_width - width of mini icon for window
       mini_icon_height - height of mini icon
       icon_width - width of large icon
       icon_height - height of large icon
       title_width - width of title text
       title_height - height of title text

    All these are always defined, except object_width/object_height 
    which only exists for <image> right now.
