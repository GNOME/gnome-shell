  <title>Creating You Own Behaviours</title>
  <para>

  Clutter comes with a number of fairly generic prebuilt behaviour
  classes which provide a basis for transitions, animations and other
  visual effects. However even with the ability to combine a number of
  these behaviours sometimes they are not enough and a custom
  behaviour is needed to create a spcific animation.

  In order to implement a new #ClutterBehaviour subclass the usual
  machinery for subclassing a GObject should be used. The new subclass
  then just overides the ClutterBehaviour::alpha_notify() method. This
  method is passed an alpha value which is then used to compute
  modifications to any actors the behaviour is applied to.

    <para>This example demonstrates a behaviour that produces a vertical
    'wipe' like affect by modifying the actors clip region</para>

  /* Normalise alpha value */

   * clutter_behaviour_actors_foreach () for performance reasons.
