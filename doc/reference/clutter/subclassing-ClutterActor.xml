  <title>Implementing a new actor</title>

  <para>In order to implement a new #ClutterActor subclass the usual
  machinery for subclassing a #GObject should be used:</para>

  <para>The implementation of an actor roughly depends on what kind
  of actor the class should display.</para>

  <para>The implementation process can be broken down into sections:

        <listitem><para>used by containers and composite actors to
        determine whether their children should allocate (and deallocate)
        specific resources associated with being added to the #ClutterStage,
        and whether their children should be painted or not. A
        #ClutterContainer implementation should not care about overriding
        the <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::realize(),
        <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::unrealize(),
        <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::map() and
        <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::unmap() virtual functions, but
        composite actors with private children MUST implement at least
        <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::map() and
        <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::unmap().</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

  </para>

  <para>Container actors should also implement the #ClutterContainer
  interface to provide a consistent API for adding, removing and iterating
  over their children.</para>

  <refsect1 id="actor-size-requisition">
    <title>Size requisition</title>

    <para>Actors should usually implement the size requisition virtual
    functions unless they depend on explicit sizing by the developer,
    using the clutter_actor_set_width() and clutter_actor_set_height()
    functions and their wrappers.</para>

    <note><para>For instance, an actor that depends on the explicit
    sizing is the #ClutterRectangle actor.</para></note>

    <para>The size requisition is split into two different phases: width
    requisition and height requisition.</para>

    <para>The <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::get_preferred_width() and
    <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::get_preferred_height() methods of a
    #ClutterActor are invoked when clutter_actor_get_preferred_width() and 
    clutter_actor_get_preferred_height() are respectively called on an instance
    of that actor class. They are used to return the preferred size of the 
    actor. Container actors, or composite actors with internal children, 
    should call clutter_actor_get_preferred_width() and 
    clutter_actor_get_preferred_height() on each visible child inside
    their implementation of the get_preferred_width() and get_preferred_height()
    virtual functions.</para>

    <para>The get_preferred_width() and get_preferred_height() virtual
    functions return both the minimum size of the actor and its natural
    size. The minimum size is defined as the amount of space an actor
    must occupy to be useful; the natural size is defined as the amount
    of space an actor would occupy if nothing would constrain it.</para>

    <note><para>The natural size must always be greater than, or equal
    to the minimum size. #ClutterActor will just ignore a natural size
    lesser than a minimum size.</para></note>

    <para>The height request may be computed for a specific width, which
    is passed to the implementation, thus allowing height-for-width
    geometry management. Similarly, the width request may be computed
    for a specific height, allowing width-for-height geometry management.
    By default, every #ClutterActor uses the height-for-width geometry
    management, but the setting can be changed by using the
    #ClutterActor:request-mode property.</para>

    <note><para>The clutter_actor_get_preferred_size() function will
    automatically check the geometry management preferred by the actor
    and return its preferred size depending on the value of the request-mode
    property and on the natural size of the actor. The get_preferred_size()
    method, though, will ignore any notion of "available size" so it should
    not be used inside a <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::allocate()
    implementation.</para></note>

    <para>The size requisition starts from the #ClutterStage and it is
    performed on every child of the stage following down the hierarchy
    of the scene graph.</para>

    <note><para>The size requisition should not take into account the
    actor's scale, rotation or anchor point unless an actor is performing
    layout management depending on those properties.</para></note>

    <note><para>All the sizes are expressed using pixels with subpixel
    precision. The sub-pixel precision is useful when animating actors
    but it can produce odd results on screen, so you might want to
    truncate the precision of the computed values.</para></note>

    <example id="clutter-actor-get-width-request-example">
      <title>Width requisition implementation of a container</title>

      <para>This example shows how an actor class should override the
      get_preferred_width() virtual function of #ClutterActor. In this case,
      the returned widths are the union of the extents of all the
      <classname>FooActor</classname> children.</para>

      <para>The get_preferred_height() implementation would be similar to the
      get_preferred_width() implementation, so it is omitted.</para>

    <title>Size allocation</title>

    <para>The <classname>ClutterActor</classname>::allocate() method of a
    #ClutterActor is invoked when clutter_actor_allocate() is called on an
    instance of that actor class. It is used by a parent actor to set the 
    coordinates of the bounding box for its children actors. Hence, 
    container actors, or composite actors with internal children, should 
    override the allocate() virtual function and call clutter_actor_allocate()
    on each visible child.</para>

    In order to implement the #ClutterContainer interface, these virtual

            #ClutterContainer::actor-added signal to notify
            handlers of the newly added actor.</para>

            <para>The container actor should increase the reference count
            of the passed #ClutterActor, remove the pointer held on the
            child and call clutter_actor_unparent() on it; then, emit the
            #ClutterContainer::actor-removed signal and decrease the
