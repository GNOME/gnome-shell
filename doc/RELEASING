RELEASING
=========

When making a new release;

 - If it's a new stable release that increments the Cogl minor version
   remember to add a new COGL_VERSION_1_X define to cogl/cogl-macros.h

 - Verify that you don't have uncommitted changes; both:

     $ git diff HEAD

   and:

     $ git diff --stat master origin/master

   should be empty.

 - Clean your work directory:

     $ git clean -xdf

   This ensures that you don't have stale files lying around.

 - Run:

     $ ./autogen.sh --enable-gtk-doc --enable-profile --enable-gles1 \
                    --enable-gles2 --enable-gl --enable-xlib-egl-platform \
                    --enable-wayland-egl-platform --enable-glx \
                    --enable-wayland-egl-server --enable-cogl-gst
     $ make all
     $ make install

   And verify that the code builds and installs from a clean Git snapshot.

 - Run checks including running the conformance tests:

    $ make check

 - Test with Clutter:

   Since we haven't migrated all the Cogl unit tests from Clutter yet, you
   should now build Clutter against Cogl and run the conformance tests:

     $ ./autogen.sh
     $ make all
     $ make test

 - Test cross-compiling for Windows:

   Please use the build/mingw/mingw-fetch-dependencies.sh with a fresh
   build directory to make sure that all of the download links still
   work.

 - Update the release documentation:

     - NEWS: new feature details, bugs fixed, acknowledgements
        - Use git shortlog -n -s to get the list of authors
        - The following bash snippet may help with extracting the list of
          bugs closed:
        - Grep the source code for "XXX: ONGOING BUG" and add a
          section about workarounds for un-resolved upstream bugs.


URLS=$(git log $1|grep bugzilla|sort|uniq)
for i in $URLS
do
  ID=$(echo $i|cut -d'=' -f2)
  TITLE=$(wget --quiet -O - $i|grep -e '<title>.*</title>'|sed -e 's/<title>Bug [0-9]\+ &ndash; \(.*\)<\/title>/\1/')
  echo "    #$ID - $TITLE"
done

     - README: dependencies, any behavioural changes relevant to
       developers;

   then commit the changes.

 - Read the release comments in configure.ac
    - Bump cogl_1_micro_version to the next even number
    - Don't change the 2.0 version number
    - Update the libtool versioning
    - Update the cogl_release_status status to "release" or "snapshot"
      as appropriate.
    - commit the changes.

 - Run:

     $ make release-publish

   which will:

     - do sanity checks on the build
     - distcheck the release
     - tag the repository with the version number
     - upload the tarball to the remote server (needs SSH account)

 - Bump cogl_1_micro_version to the next odd number
 - Revert cogl_release_status to "git"

 - Push the branch and then the tag, e.g.:

     $ git push origin master
     $ git push origin 1.7.0

 - Announce release to the waiting world on the blog and mailing lists. Use
   the template printed by `make release-publish`.
