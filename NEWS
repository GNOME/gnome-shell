  • List of changes since Clutter 1.18.0

    - Fix the list of dependencies
    Clutter 1.18 depends on Cogl 1.17.5 when building the EGL/KMS backend.

    - Fixes for the Visual Studio build files
    Use the new symbol visibility annotations when building with MSVC.

    - Fix event handling on Windows
    An optimization led to a crash on the Windows backend when delivering
    events without an associated ClutterStage.

    - Ensure that set_child_above/below work on the Stage
    ClutterStage should respect the paint order when using the Actor API.

    - Skip conformance test suite on X11 when DISPLAY is unset
    Instead of bailing out when initializing the test suite we should just
    tell the test suite API to skip the units. This allows the TAP driver
    to catch the skipped tests and avoid warnings.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.17.4

    - Use libinput instead of libevdev
    The evdev input backend is now based on libinput instead of directly
    using the evdev API; this allows for shared input behaviour with
    different toolkits.

    - Improvements in the X11 input handling
    Remove the chance of input devices going out of sync; avoid excessive
    round trips when asking for the client pointer; retrieve the text
    direction for the current keymap.

    - Improve RTL handling in ClutterText
    Try to use the correct text direction based on the contents, keymap,
    and actor's direction instead of just the latter.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.16.0

    - Allow ClutterScript definitions for Interval and Transition classes
    ClutterInterval instances can be defined, and used, in ClutterScript
    UI definition files.

    - Add generic API for event filtering
    Event filtering is meant to be used to intercept events before they
    reach the scene graph.

    - Deprecated ClutterTableLayout
    The Table layout manager is fully superceded by ClutterGridLayout, which
    supports dynamic grid layouts, RTL flipping, expansion and alignment of
    children using the ClutterActor flags, and implicit animations using the
    actor's easing state.

    - Allow GestureAction subclasses to change the trigger edge
    GestureAction can emit the ::gesture-begin signal depending on the
    value of the :threshold-trigger-edge property. Using this property it
    is possible to specify whether the gesture begins after a certain
    threshold is passed; before a certain threshold is passed; or
    immediately.

    - Use the window scaling factor when creating Cairo surfaces
    ClutterCanvas will use the window scaling factor setting when creating
    Cairo surfaces; it is also possible to set the scaling factor on a
    per-instance basis, for future compatibility.

    - Detect window scaling factor automatically on X11
    Use the XSETTING exposed by the environment to change the window
    scaling factor.

    - Support ClutterStage cursor visibility in the Wayland backend
    It is possible to show and hide the cursor on the Stage on Wayland.

    Galician, Italian, Spanish.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.15.92

    - Improve the evdev input backend
    The evdev input backend is used when writing applications and compositors
    that directly drive the frame buffer on Linux. By ensuring that the evdev
    input backend works correctly it is possible to manage input sources like
    pointers, keyboards, and touch devices using the raw evdev device nodes.
    Clutter now depends on libevdev in order to poll the evdev interfaces.

    - Allow scaling windowing surfaces
    The main part of the work to support high resolution displays is to make
    sure that windowing surfaces can be created with a scaling factor, while
    trasparently handling the new size from an application's perspective. The
    scaling factor is currently set manually, but it in the near future it will
    be automatically set by the environment.

    reduce the amount of work necessary when updating the scene graph.

    - Wayland backend improvements and updates

    - Documentation updates
    Clean up the API reference for readability, and improve the comments in
    the inlined example code. Also, include the cookbook in the distribution
    tarball.

    - Add ClutterTapAction, a gesture recogniser for single touch taps.

    - Add ClutterSwipeAction::swipe
    This new signal has a boolean return value, and brings the SwipeAction in
    line with the rest of the GestureAction sub-classes. The ::swept signal
    has also been deprecated.

    - Enable XInput 2.x support by default
    Instead of using Xlib core events. The clutter_x11_enable_xinput() function
    now does not do anything; it's possible to disable XInput support by using
    the CLUTTER_DISABLE_XINPUT environment variable.

    - Fix the device tracking for core X11 pointers
    If a master input device can emit both touch and pointer events we end up
    in an inconsistent state; we should account for this case when tracking
    the stage that contains the events of each input device.

    - Respect text direction in BinLayout
    The text direction of the children of an actor using the BinLayout layout
    manager should be taken into account, both when using the Actor's align
    flags and when using the legacy BinAlignment flags.

    - Translations updates
    Hindi, Telugu, Catalan, Malayalam, Japanese, Bulgarian, Kannada.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.14

    - Fixes for gesture-based actions
    Ensure that the ClutterPanAction::pan-stopped signal is emitted before
    the ClutterGestureAction::gesture-begin signal, in case a new gesture
    starts; this requires adding a new state to ClutterGestureAction, the
    gesture-prepare state.

    - Ensure modified Enter keys do not end up in the Text buffer
    For single-line ClutterText actors.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.12

    - Fixes for the touch sequence handling
    The stage associated with an input device is now set when a touch sequence
    begins, and cleared when the last touch sequence ends.

    - Add interpolation for matrices
    Using the CSS3 Transforms specification for decomposing matrices and
    interpolating the resulting transformations. This allows animating
    properties like ClutterActor:transform and ClutterActor:child-transform.

    - Add ClutterPanAction
    The PanAction is a gesture recogniser that allows panning children of
    a "scrollable" viewport.

    - Add more accessors to GestureAction for its subclasses
    GestureAction now allows retrieving the velocity and delta of pointer,
    as well as the event sequences and devices involved in the gesture. This
    allows writing more complex gesture recognisers. It is also possible, now,
    to ask a GestureAction to cancel the current gesture programmatically,
    e.g. from a timer.

    - Fix ClutterTableLayout.pack() with negative row/column
    Using a negative number to appen an actor into a TableLayout was causing
    additional rows and columns to be appended, due to an off by one error.

    - Fix press coordinates when using ClutterDragAction with a drag handle
    The transformation of the coordinates is now done using the drag actor,
    as it was supposed to be.

    - Documentation and annotation fixes

    - Deprecate the ClutterActor::pick signal
    Similarly to the ClutterActor::paint signal, it's now discouraged to
    connect to the ClutterActor::pick signal; connecting to the pick signal
    will raise a warning when using the CLUTTER_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC environment
    variable.

    - Updated translations
    Lithuanian, Indonesian, Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong and Taiwan),
    Polish, Spanish, Assamese, Greek, Spanish, Polish, Galician,
    Belarusian.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.10

    - ClutterBinLayout honours the fixed-position of actors
    The ClutterBinLayout now checks if the :fixed-position-set property of a
    ClutterActor is set, and will use the fixed position when computing the
    allocation, without requiring an explicit CLUTTER_BIN_ALIGNMENT_FIXED
    alignment policy.

    - Soft-deprecation of ClutterGeometry
    The ClutterGeometry boxed type is a bad rectangle type, with known issues
    when used for unioning and intersecting; Clutter uses the type in signals
    and properties, so we cannot fully deprecate it. The documentation has
    been amended, and API using ClutterGeometry has been deprecated where it
    makes sense.

    - Deprecate the ClutterActor::paint signal
    The class handler for ClutterActor::paint is still available, but
    connecting to the ::paint signal directly is strongly discouraged, and
    will emit warnings if the CLUTTER_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC environment variable
    is set. Notifications of a full paint for the Stage should happen only
    through the repaint functions.

    - Ensure we associate input devices to the stage on touch events
    Like we do for crossing events for pointer devices, beginning and ending
    a touch sequence should associate the input device to the stage.

    - Allow constraining a DragAction to an area
    Similarly to how we allow constraining the dragging to an axis, we can
    also constrain the dragging to a specific area, expressed in
    parent-relative coordinates.

    - Do not handle events on ClutterText if :selectable is FALSE
    If the ClutterText:selectable property is FALSE we should only reposition
    the cursor, and avoid the whole drag-to-select event handling.

    - Add ClutterActor:child-transform
    The :child-transform property allows applying an initial transformation
    to the children of an actor, but not to the actor itself.

    - Fix height-for-width policy in ClutterBinLayout

    - Add ClutterZoomAction
    An action that implements the pinch gesture to scale an actor up or
    down through two touch points.

    - Documentation fixes

    - Translations update
    Assamese, Indonesian, Ukranian, Traditional Chinese translation (Hong
    Kong and Taiwan), Spanish, Galician, Serbian.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.8

    - Add support for multiple touch points in GestureAction
    GestureAction subclasses can now define the number of touch points they
    require in order to start recognising a gesture.

    - Add a RotateAction
    A GestureAction subclass that requires two touch points to rotate the
    actor to which it has been applied.

    - Generate crossing events for touch devices

    - Respect ClutterStage.set_motion_events_enabled() for touch events

    - Fix a regression in discrete scroll events emission
    When using XInput 2, the scroll events generated through buttons (e.g.
    mouse wheel) should only be emitted on ButtonPress, to match the semantics
    of the X11 core device handling.

    - Add progress functions defined in CSS3-Transitions
    The CSS3 Transitions specification defines various timing functions:

      steps                     cubic-bezier
      step-start                ease
      step-end                  ease-in
                                ease-out
                                ease-in-out

    These are now available to be used with ClutterTimeline.

    - Add ClutterActor::transition-stopped
    The ::transition-stopped signal is emitted each time a Transition
    associated to an actor is stopped (using the same sematincs as the
    ClutterTimeline::stopped signal); it is also a detailed signal, so that
    it's possible to connect a handler for a specific Transition name.

    - Add ClutterActor.transform
    The :transform property allows overriding all the decomposed
    transformations of an actor, like scale and rotate; the transformation
    is applied relative to the actor's allocated origin and pivot point.

    - Documentation and build fixes

    - Translations update
     Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong and Taiwan), Spanish, Galician,
     Serbian, Greek.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.6

    - Bump the dependency of ATK
    Use the newly released 2.5.3 to rely on the generci event listeners
    that have been added to ATK; this avoids reimplementing our own.

    - Ensure validity of iterators
    Even when they are copied.

    - Rounding error fixes for allocations
    Constraints and other code adjusting the allocation of an actor should
    round the origin and size of the ClutterActorBox in a consistent way.

    - Updates for the VisualStudio build files

    - Add ClutterDragAction::drag-progress
    The ::drag-progress signal allows controlling the emission of the
    ::drag-motion signal. Overriding the default behaviour of a DragAction
    is now possible without calling g_signal_stop_emission_by_name().

    - Add ClutterActor:pivot-point
    The pivot point of ClutterActor provides a center, in normalized
    coordinate space, for the transformations of an actor (scaling, rotation,
    translation).

    - Deprecations
    ClutterText:position has been deprecated by ClutterText:cursor-position,
    for consistency with other ClutterText properties, as well as to avoid
    shadowing the ClutterActor:position property. ClutterActor:depth has
    been deprecated by ClutterActor:z-position. ClutterTexture has been
    deprecated in favour of ClutterImage. ClutterActor:anchor-[xy] and the
    transformation centers for rotation and scaling have been deprecated
    in favour of the ClutterActor:pivot-point. The clutter_threads_enter()
    and clutter_threads_leave() functions have been deprecated.

    - Removal of the experimental ClutterLayoutManager easing state API
    The easing state API for ClutterLayoutManager was added in 1.11.2, but
    with the introduction of a default easing state for ClutterActor it is
    now redundant and not necessary; to animate the allocation of an actor
    during layout it's simply necessary to set its easing state. All layout
    managers provided by Clutter have been updated.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.4

    - Accessibility fixes
    Clean up key listeners; implement AtkText missing methods for getting text
    before and after a given offset.

    - Ensure that ClutterBinLayout honours the fixed positioning

    - Improvements in GridLayout

    - Improve debugging messages
    We now print out the name, type, and pointer address of each actor when
    emitting debugging messages; also, all messages within one second are
    grouped together and show the delta instead of a full timestamp, to
    improve readability.

    - Add ClutterActor:content-repeat
    The content-repeat property can be used by a ClutterContent implementation
    to control the repeating of the content's data or pattern. ClutterImage
    and ClutterCanvas honour this property.

    - Explicit animation API improvements
    ClutterTransition will now ask the ClutterAnimatable associated to it
    for its initial or final state, in case either is missing; also, the
    interpolated value will be coerced to the correct property type instead
    of generating a warning.

    - Switch to lcov for test coverage

    - Remove an extra reference on ClutterStage
    The reference added during dispose introduced a leak in case a stage was
    destroyed.

    - Improve touch event support
    New API to install a grab on a specific event sequence of an input device;
    ClutterText now responds to touch events; ClutterDragAction and
    ClutterDropAction also use touch events as well as pointer events. The
    conformance and interactive test suites now have units for checking touch
    event handling.

===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.11.2

    - Multi-touch support fixes
    The clutter_event_copy() code was copying the wrong axis data; the correct
    touch device was not used when translating axis data from XInput2 to the
    ClutterInputDevice; touch events were not delivered to the correct actors.

    - Add ClutterDropAction::drop-cancel signal
    The ::drop-cancel does what it says on the tin: it allows handling a
    cancelled drop action, instead of relying on the drag end signal on
    the ClutterDragAction.

    - Add examples in the repository
    Clutter has been using some interactive tests as examples of idiomatic
    usage, both as standalone code and for inclusion inside the API reference
    documentation; this is sub-optimal, as the interactive tests are meant to
    exercise the API and its behaviour, not as an example of how to write
    proper Clutter code. For this reason, we now have an examples/ directory
    that contains example code that can be used to learn Clutter.

    - Allow disabling the tests and examples when building Clutter
    This should help cross-compilation and testing.

    - Fix the preferred size to always include the actor's margin

    - Fix picking of the ClutterScrollActor

    - Add implicit animations for the color properties of ClutterText
    Changing any color-related properties of a ClutterText actor will result
    in a transition, if the easing state has a non-zero duration.

    - Layout managers should respect the child expand and align properties
    ClutterBinLayout, ClutterBoxLayout, and ClutterTableLayout should use the
    ClutterActor [xy]-expand and [xy]-align properties, and deprecate their
    own.

    - Make all layout managers respect the child easing state when allocating
    ClutterLayoutManager also has properties that can be set to control all
    the children's default easing state.

    - Add ClutterTimeline::stopped signal
    The ::stopped signal is emitted either when a Timeline reaches full
    completion, including eventual repeats; or when the Timeline has been
    stopped through clutter_timeline_stop(). A boolean argument passed to
    the signal handlers should be used to distinguish the two cases.

    - Add ClutterGridLayout
    This layout manager implements the same layout policy of GtkGrid.

    - Fixes for ClutterKeyframeTransition

    - Documentation fixes

    - Fixes for building Clutter with Visual Studio
    Including the GDK backend.

    - Fixes for the Mac backend
    Chain up to get a Cogl context after creating a GL context; this seems
    to be enough to make the interactive tests run.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.10

    - Add ClutterScrollActor
    An actor that can display a portion of its children, as well as
    transitioning between visible regions.

    - Make clutter_actor_allocate() respect the easing state of the actor
    This allows animating allocations in layout managers.

    - Add automatic expansion flags for ClutterActor
    Actors can be marked to by allocated extra space by their parent, or
    by the layout manager used by their parent; the expansion flags are also
    recursive, so they can be set on a leaf node of the actor tree, and
    propagate further up automatically.

    - Add ClutterTransitionGroup and ClutterKeyframeTransition
    Two ClutterTransition implementation that allow creating complex
    transitions.

    - Provide more C convenience API to ClutterTransition
    Instead of dealing with ClutterInterval instances, it's possible to
    define the starting and final values of a transition.

    - Provide base geometric types: point, size, rectangle
    Along with commodity API.

    - New round of deprecations
    ClutterMedia, ClutterCairoTexture, clutter_actor_animate(),
    ClutterAnimation, ClutterAnimator, ClutterState, ClutterLayoutManager's
    animation API.

    - Return a valid default PaintVolume in more cases
    For actors not overriding paint() or get_paint_volume() we can already
    infer enough information on the area thatis going to be painted, and return
    a valid paint volume. We specifically ignore any painting going on inside
    a ClutterActor::paint signal handler, as that is considered legacy and on
    its way to deprecation. People overriding the paint sequence of an actor
    from within a paint signal handler, and painting outside the allocation,
    are evil anyway.

    - Depend on Pango 1.30

Clutter 1.9.16                                                       2012-03-19

  • Clutter 1.10.0, release-candidate 1

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.14

    - Support implicit animatable properties
    Various properties of ClutterActor can now be implicitly animated when
    using the public setters, instead of going through the animation API;
    this is an opt-in mechanism for the 1.x API series.

    - Introduce paint nodes
    ClutterPaintNode is an element of the render tree; it is used to store
    the pipeline state and the geometry to be drawn. Actors have the ability
    to be painted using the paint nodes by overriding the paint_node() virtual
    function instead of the paint() virtual function. For the 1.x API series
    the render tree will be consumed per-actor, but the plan is to build a
    full tree as the authoritative source for the 2.x API series.

    - Support Content delegates
    ClutterContent is an interface that allows creating classes that will
    painted in place of an actor's paint() virtual function. Clutter provides
    two content types: Canvas, a Cairo-based immediate canvas for drawing the
    contents of an actor; and Image, a content that will paint image data.

    - ClutterText improvements
    The caret of editable text actors is now centered, and the background
    color will be respected when painting the actor.

    - Support for the XInput 2.2 extension
    Clutter will now relay touch events coming from the X server, as well
    as precise scrolling delta, for devices with those two capabilities.
    The support is still experimental, and limited to the X11 platform for
    the time being.

    - Translation updates

    Chinese (Hong Kong and Taiwan), British English, Hebrew, Polish, Catalan,

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.12

    - Support custom versioning boundaries for the API
    Now that GLib provides macros for changing the minimum required and
    maximum allowed version of a library, Clutter can respect the
    boundaries expressed using CLUTTER_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED and
    CLUTTER_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED.

    - Add version information to deprecations

    - Move all deprecated symbols to separate header files

    - Documentation and annotation fixes.

    - Accessibility fixes in Cally
    Do not use ClutterActor:name as the accessible name, and do not
    provide the extents of an accessible object if the actor to which
    it refers is not on screen.

    - Updates to the Wayland compositor and client support
    Clutter now allows being used for creating hybrid Wayland/X11
    compositors, working with KMS and evdev directly.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.10

    - Add ClutterTimeline:repeat-count and deprecate :loop
    The :repeat-count property supercedes the :loop property, and it
    provides a way to specify the number of repeats that a timeline
    should perform - with the option of specifying an "infinity" value.

    - Add a progress mode for ClutterTimeline
    This begins the "soft deprecation" of ClutterAlpha. Instead of
    requiring a full object to compute an easing function out of a
    linear progress coming from ClutterTimeline, we should have this
    functionality on ClutterTimeline itself. Since ClutterAlpha is
    still exposed in API that we cannot deprecate (such as virtual
    functions) we cannot deprecate it fully, and we'll have to wait
    until the 2.0 API bump to get rid of it.

    - Fix ClutterBoxLayout allocation
    Since the update of the box layout algorithm there have been a
    bunch of regressions; now the layout works as intended.

    - Improve the performance of the shader-based effect in Clutter
    The effects shipped with Clutter now use the CoglSnippet API
    internally, which allows efficient generation of the shader code;
    they also ensure that the shader is generated once per class, and
    shared across instances. These changes should improve performance
    when using effects provided by Clutter.

    - Update the internal usage of Cogl API
    Clutter should strive to use the Cogl 2.0 API internally and not
    mix the 1.0 and 2.0 API.

    - Allow accessing Wayland input devices
    This is a change that allows Clutter-based toolkits to interact
    with Wayland in a meaningful way for operations like resize and
    move.

    - Add a convenience CLUTTER_BIND_ALL enumeration
    This allows binding both position and size of an actor when using
    a ClutterBindConstraint.

    - Cally updates
    Use the newly added API to reimplement focus tracking.

    - Visual Studio project updates

    - Add clutter_text_coords_to_position()
    This method roundtrips the position_to_coords() one, and allows
    retrieving the index of the character at the given actor-relative
    coordinates.

    - Documentation updates.

    - Introspection annotation fixes.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.8

    - Provide symbolic names for pointer buttons
    The primary, middle, and secondary pointer buttons now have simple and
    easy to remember constants that can be used in place of the "magic"
    numbers.

    - Add ClutterActorIter
    A simple API, using a stack allocated opaque structure, for safely and
    efficiently traverse the children of a ClutterActor.

    - Fix regression introduced by the default FixedLayout layout manager
    Existing ClutterActor subclasses using their own layout management should
    now work exactly like in Clutter 1.8.

    - Documentation fixes
    Including introspection annotations fixes.

    - Updates to the Wayland backend
    The Wayland client backend is now up to date with the 0.85 release of
    the Wayland protocol.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.6

    - Fix regressions in users of deprecated API
    Also, allow to mix the new Actor API with the old Container API without
    breaking.

    - Add GResource support in ClutterScript
    GResource is a new infrastructure in GIO that allows to compile resources
    like UI builder files and image data into a shared library or an
    executable. A newly added method to ClutterScript makes it possible to
    load a UI definition from a resource, like it's done for files and
    data.

    - Update the Wayland client backend
    The SHM transport API has changed upstream, and the Clutter backend has
    been updated to reflect it.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.4

    - Deprecate clutter_actor_show_all() and clutter_actor_hide_all()
    The latter never did make a lot of sense: hiding the parent will
    effectively hide the children as well; the former was there only for
    convenience, but Actors are visible by default.

    - Gracefully handle existing code
    The changes in ClutterActor introduced regressions in existing code
    because of the new functionaly that was introduced to replace deprecated
    classes like Box and Group. These regressions have hopefully been fixed;
    Clutter 1.9.6 has been tested with a project as complex as the GNOME
    Shell.

    - Fix build with binutils-gold
    The private dependencies were not used when building Clutter, and this
    made the Gold linker angry.

    - Allow tracking of an actor's first and last child
    ClutterActor has two new properties, :first-child and :last-child; these
    are read-only properties that can be used by toolkits based on Clutter
    to track the first and last child whenever they change.

    - Bump the Cogl dependency
    The 1.9.4 release depended on Cogl ≥ 1.9.4, but the minimum required
    version was not bumped along with the changes.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.9.2

    - New scene graph API in ClutterActor
    ClutterActor now provides the API for adding, removing, and iterating
    over the list of children; this deprecates most of the ClutterContainer
    API. ClutterActor implements ClutterContainer as well, which means that
    all actors can be containers.

    - Layout management updates
    ClutterActor now have an horizontal and vertical alignment properties
    that will be used when added to a parent; a margin has also been added
    to the ClutterActor class. Both margin and alignment will be automatically
    managed during the allocation, so they will work out of the box. It is
    also possible to set a ClutterLayoutManager delegate object on any
    ClutterActor instance: the LayoutManager will take care of the layout
    policy for the children of an actor.

    - Add ClutterTextBuffer
    The ClutterTextBuffer class provides a storage for the contents of
    a ClutterText actor; the same instance can be shared across different
    actors as well. The main use for ClutterTextBuffer is implementing
    secure memory storage for the contents of a ClutterText in password
    mode.

    - Deprecations
    ClutterGroup, ClutterBox, and ClutterRectangle have been deprecated; their
    functionality is now available directly in ClutterActor. The old child
    actor management API in ClutterActor and ClutterContainer has been
    deprecated as well. Other deprecations include the ClutterStage
    fog-related properties and API; the ClutterContainer.sort_depth_order(),
    raise(), and lower() virtual functions; the internal child push and
    pop methods on ClutterActor.

    - ClutterTimeline can parse markers from ClutterScript
    Markers can now be defined inside ClutterScript, and a ClutterTimeline
    will be able to automatically add them from a UI definition.

    - Add a diagnostic mode
    Similar to the GLib diagnostic mode, Clutter now supports an environment
    variable that will print out diagnostic messages for deprecations and
    warnings that can only be detected at run-time.

    - Wayland backend updates
    The wayland backend now tracks the latest API changes in the client API,
    and Clutter now provides a Wayland surface actor that allows to write
    Wayland compositors, similarly to the X11TexturePixmap actor for the
    X11 backend.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.8

    - Multi-backend build, and run-time backend selection
    Clutter can be built with support for multiple backends in the same
    shared library; the backend singleton is determined at run-time,
    either with the default backend for the platform, or using the value
    of the CLUTTER_BACKEND environment variable.

    - GDK windowing system backend
    A new backend has been added, which uses the GDK API for creating the
    drawing surface, as well as receiving the windowing system and input
    events.

    - Show a hint when ClutterText is in password mode
    If the password-hint-time ClutterSettings property is set to a non
    zero value, the last character entered inside a ClutterText actor when
    in password mode will be shown in plain for the duration of the timeout,
    before being replaced by the glyph chosen as the password character.

    - Improve Windows build support
    Clutter now provides project files to build the library using Visual
    Studio 9 and Visual Studio 10. Also, the scripts to build Clutter using
    MinGW have been improved.

    - Remove the requirement for using clutter_threads_init()
    Threads are initialized by default (depending on the platform), so there
    is no need to call clutter_threads_init().

    - Deprecate the default ClutterStage
    The semantics of the default Stage were not obvious, and had the tendency
    to confuse the user.

    - Move the deprecated headers into their own directory
    This should help developers identify the deprecated API.

    - Change deprecation policy
    Deprecated functions are now marked using compiler annotations, instead
    of being forcibly disabled through pre-processor directives from the
    headers. Deprecations will cause compiler warnings, and thus are enabled
    by default. If you're building your project with compiler flags that
    consider every warning a fatal error, you can use the symbol
    CLUTTER_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS to disable the deprecation warnings.

    - Translation updates

    - Make sure that setting :use-markup does not depend on the order
    Setting the :use-markup property should yield the same results regardless

    ClutterText defined using ClutterScript as well.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.12

    - Use newer version of ATK
    Cally now depends on the latest version of ATK, to reduce the amount of
    ad hoc code needed and to use newer features that simplify the
    implementation of accessible objects in Clutter.

    - Allow using Layout Managers with generic containers
    Layout managers should not assume that they are allocating the whole
    area available from the Actor using them; this allows actors that
    support concepts like padding or margin to use a LayoutManager internally
    for its children.

    - Cookbook updates
    Add a recipe on how to bind a ClutterState to the signals of objects
    defined in ClutterScript. We also install the cookbook examples inside
    the $datadir/clutter-1.0/cookbook/examples directory.

    - Improve examples in the API reference
    Some of the interactive test suite units are actually good examples of
    how to use the Clutter API; we can use the XInclude tags to include the
    source code inside the API reference.

    - Ensure thread safety of the repaint functions add/removal
    Fix a long standing issue where adding or removing repaint functions
    was not acquiring a lock; now it's safe to manipulate the repaint
    functions list from different threads.

    - Make the ClutterText:line-wrap property work again
    In 1.2 the :line-wrap property was broken, and ClutterText would paint
    a PangoLayout wrapping until it fit the height of the allocation
    regardless of whether the :line-wrap property was set to FALSE or
    TRUE. Now we clip the PangoLayout before rendering it, if the :line-wrap
    property is set to FALSE and there is no ellipsization policy set.

    - Disable redirection to offscreen buffer by default
    Whenever a ClutterActor with children was not fully opaque, the actor
    was redirected to an FBO, to perform correct opacity computations.
    Sadly, this can lead to 3x slowdowns, given the amount of framebuffer
    objects created and the state changes that have to be performed. We
    decided to turn off this feature by default, to avoid the performance
    hit. It is still possible to enable this feature on a per-actor basis,
    though, and will work to reduce the hit in future versions of Cogl,
    Clutter and the drivers.

Clutter 1.7.12                                                       2011-08-29

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.10

    - Reload the font caches on X11 when the user installs a new font
    Whenever the user installs a new font inside one of the directories that
    ware being watched by a session daemon, or changes the fontconfig
    configuration, the toolkits using FontConfig (either directly or indirectly
    e.g. through Pango, like Clutter) should listen to the Fontconfig/Timestamp
    XSETTINGS key and release all the font configuration caches. This allows
    selecting the newly installed fonts without requiring the user to restart
    the application.

    - Allow using "font-description" as a ClutterScript alias for "font-name"
    ClutterText:font-description allows passing a PangoFontDescription
    directly to a ClutterText; when defining a ClutterText instance inside a
    ClutterScript file, :font-description should be an alias for :font-name,
    which takes a string and converts it to a PangoFontDescription.

    - Make sure that LayoutManager subclasses take the allocation origin
      into account when allocating the children
    A LayoutManager should be resilient against allocations with an origin
    not positioned at (0, 0); this allows actors using a layout manager
    instance to munge the box and implement things like margin and padding
    without the layout manager having knowledge of those concepts.

    - Build fixes
    Always link against libm when building Clutter (and its tests); don't
    rely on libraries lower on the stack to do so.

    - Documentation fixes

    - Do not update the last paint volume when picking
    Last minute fix for an issue that was most prominently manifesting itself
    when using GNOME Shell with Clutter 1.7; this should resolve the issue
    that dragging icons from the dash left around some stale pixels.

    - Fix building the tests
    The performance and micro-benchmark tests did not pick up changes in
    local dependencies, e.g. under a JHBuild root.

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.6

    - Various fixes in Cally
    Make sure to use Clutter's API and remove old workarounds that were put
    into place when Cally was a separate project and targeting pre-1.0 API
    versions of Clutter.

    - Add ClutterCairoTexture:auto-resize
    This property makes it easier to create 2D canvas surfaces by tracking
    the actor's allocation in a backward compatible way.

    - Add ClutterAnimatable.interpolate_value()
    This new virtual function deprecates the animate_property() virtual of the
    Animatable interface, which was sub-optimal in different ways.

    - Allow using Animatable implementations with ClutterState
    Thanks to the new interpolate_value() virtual it is now possible to use
    the Animatable interface with ClutterState; this allows animating
    action, constraint and effect properties using the same "@" syntax also
    used by ClutterAnimation and clutter_actor_animate().

    - Improve ClutterModel's implementation
    Avoid a bunch of needless checks, and make sure that the ::row-changed
    signal is emitted in all cases when a row has been changed through the
    ClutterModelIter API. The conformance test unit for ClutterModel has
    also been improved to avoid future regressions.

    - Improve ClutterStage behaviour on OS X
    Make sure that the fullscreen, multi-screen and key focusing are
    well-behaved on OS X, by implementing the correct delegate methods.

  • List of bugs fixed since Clutter 1.7.6

  #655387 - Missing GObject introspection annotations
  #655306 - Added windowDidChangeScreen delegate to fix pick errors when

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.4

    - Accessibility fixes in Cally
    Fix the implementation of the AtkText interface for ClutterText.

    - Depend on the new Cogl windowing system API.

    - Add functions for retrieving the clip boundaries on the Stage
    The clutter_stage_get_redraw_clip_bounds() function is useful for
    window managers (like Mutter) that need to retrieve the clipped
    region used on the Stage.

    - Auto-detect the default flavour when building
    The default flavour used when building should be set depending
    on the platform.

    - Mark the OSX backend as non-experimental
    The OSX backend is being developed, and maintained, so it should
    not be considered experimental.

    - Make sure that Gestures are cancelled when missing release events

    - Correct the rounding for paint volumes
    Try to provide stable results against potential floating point rounding
    margins when projecting 3D paint volumes into screen bounding boxes;
    this should avoid re-creating FBOs and always correctly handle clipped
    redraws.

    - Do not clobber XI2 events data
    This allows to play along with other toolkits using XI2.

    - Fix ClutterSnapConstraint's right edge snapping

    - Deprecations
    ClutterScore, clutter_texture_new_from_actor(),
    clutter_cairo_texture_create*()

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.7.2

    - Unify the GLX and EGL backends to be a single code base
    The GLX and EGL backends shared most of their code, and with the split
    out Cogl, we can unify the code base into a single backend. The API as
    well as the ABI are preserved.

    - Restore a wider range of Z values for actors
    The computation for the near and far planes given the perspective
    transformation used to set up the viewport was broken in 1.7.2, and
    the distance from the focal point was greatly reduced. This has now
    been fixed.

    - Bump up the dependency of Cogl
    New windowing system API in Cogl required bumping the minimum version
    to the latest development snapshot, 1.7.2.

    - Add ClutterDropAction
    The ClutterDropAction is an action for allowing ClutterActors to react
    when an actor being dragged through ClutterDragAction crosses, or is
    dropped over, them.

    - Add a performance test suite
    This suite is an addition to our conformance and interactive test
    suites; the infrastructure can be used by buildbots and report tools
    to track performance regressions across various commits.

    - Documentation and annotation fixes

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.6.0

    - Cogl moved out of tree
    The Clutter OpenGL abstraction library has been moved to a separate
    repository and can be used as a stand-alone shared library. Clutter
    has been modified to depend on Cogl's experimental API.

    - Correctly composite non fully opaque children
    Non fully opauqe actors with non fully opaque children will automatically
    redirect children paint operations to offscreen buffers, which allow
    correct composition taking into account the overall opacity of the scene's
    sub-graph. The same mechanism can be used to create a paint cache, and
    paint that cache when the actor or its children do not change, instead of
    painting the whole sub-graph again.

    - Allow connecting signals to ClutterState states in ClutterScript
    When defining a scene using ClutterScript it's possible to directly
    connect a state inside a ClutterState object (both defined in
    ClutterScript or in code) to an object's signal, without using an
    explicit signal handler in the code.

    - Long-press handling in ClutterClickAction
    ClutterClickAction will detect a long-press gesture and emit signals
    to query, activation and cancellation.

    - Added ClutterGestureAction and ClutterSwipeAction
    ClutterGestureAction is a generic "pointer gesture" action; it doesn't
    provide an implementation: it's up to the developer to add the gesture
    recognition code. ClutterSwipeAction is a GestureAction sub-class that
    implement the "swipe" gesture. The GestureAction API is already future
    proof for multi-device/multi-touch, even though the multi-touch isn't
    currently implemented.

    - Allow Effects to influence picking
    Effects that change the geometry of a ClutterActor should also be
    allowed to change the picking code to make sure that event handling
    keeps working. ClutterEffect has a new pick() virtual function for
    these cases.

      API provide access to the same features.

    » Be more resilient against timelines controlling the state of
      other timelines during the clock tick.

    » Provide defines for the windowing platforms, to allow portable
      applications to include the correct header and select the
      correct API depending on the target.

    » Introduce a fast path for cogl_read_pixels() that uses the journal
      to determine the position of a single pixel on the stage; this
      fast path gracefully degrades to the usual render-based approach,
      and should speed up picking considerably in the case of opaque
      quads batched together.

    » Support XInput axis data on valuator devices, and introduce XInput2
      support for event translation and device hotplugging. The support
      for XI and XI2 must still be explicitly enabled by the developer,
      but it is now compiled in by default. It can be disabled at compile
      time by passing --disable-xinput to the configure script.

===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.5.4

    » Deprecate ClutterBehaviour and its sub-classes: the same functionality
      is available using the animation framework.

    » Add ClutterSnapConstraint, a constraint implementation that snaps
      together the edges of two actors.

    » Add ClutterPathConstraint::node-reached.

    » Deprecate ClutterTimeoutPool and ClutterFrameSource: this API is
      not used internally any more, and since it's not integrated with
      the master clock it's of relative use.

    » Add a named, global color palette.

    » Add the ClutterTimeline:reverse property, for automatically
      reversing the direction of a timeline after the emission of
      the ::completed signal.

    » Performance improvements in the clip stack.

    » Do not use pointer grabs in ClutterClickAction.

    » Improve the internally used Cogl API for primitives, paths and

    » Allow using the COGL_DEBUG environment variable to disable the
      NPOTs support.

    » Plug a nasty infinite loop in the XSETTINGS implementation.

    » Internally rename CoglMaterial to CoglPipeline; this should make
      it clearer that the API refers to the state of the GPU pipeline.

    » Add support for clipped redraws on EGL using the NOK_swap_region
      extension.

    » Build fixes.

    » Use the monotonic clock API if compiling against GLib ≥ 2.27.3.

Clutter 1.5.2  (04/10/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.4.0

    » Add API to ClutterActor to allow any actor to define its 3D paint
      volume and its stage-relative 2D bounding box; the paint volume is
      the 3D space occupied by an actor during the paint sequence. This
      allows better sizing of the FBOs, and opens the door to scenegraph
      culling and accurate clipped redraws. The mechanism is opt-in: actors
      have to implement the get_paint_volume() virtual function. Callbacks
      attached to the ::paint signal will also disable any culling and
      clipped redraw in place internally.

    » Plug a leak in ClutterActor by disposing all constraints.

    » Rework the build system to be as non-recursive as possible; this should
      speed up the build of Clutter, and makes the build layout easier to
      understand and update.

    » Remove the internal copy of JSON-GLib; the internal copy was falling
      behind at a spectacular level, and it was actually making the build
      rather complicated - also by adding an unwanted, but needed,
      introspection data generation. The required JSON-GLib has also been
      bumped to the new stable release, 0.12.0.

    » Use g_object_install_properties() with GLib 2.26.

    » Implement ClutterContainer::child-notify, which slipped through the
      cracks of many development cycles without anyone noticing.

    » Document and test clutter_actor_contains(), especially the corner
      cases.

    » Plug a leak in CoglTexture2DSliced.

    » Plug a leak in ClutterAnimator's handling of timelines.

    » Trap glXDestroyPixmap() in CoglTexturePixmapX11 to avoid BadDrawable
      errors when the GLX pixmap is destroyed behind Cogl's back.

    » Depend on GObject-Introspection >= 0.9.5.

    » Provide introspection data for the X11-specific API, like
      ClutterX11TexturePixmap

    » Use a template material for ClutterTexture to minimize the creation of
      new materials.

    » Split ClutterDragAction:drag-threshold into two, per-axis properties:
      :x-drag-threshold and :y-drag-threshold.

    » Allow disabling the -Bsymbolic flag when linking.

    » Use gettext >= 0.17 to handle the localization.

    » Flush the framebuffer earlier when drawing the vertex buffers, to fix
      a crash when dealing with clip stacks.

    » Make sure ClutterX11TexturePixmap removes the Cogl texture handle before
      freeing the X11 Pixmap to avoid an error.

Clutter 1.3.6 (30/06/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.3.4

    » Provide a fallback on GLX if the MESA_copy_sub_buffer extension is not
      available, by using EXT_framebuffer_blit. Both mechanisms are also
      throttled to avoid taking all resources when using them in a compositor
      like Mutter.

    » Use (and cache) fragment shaders instead of texture combiners inside
      Cogl materials. Cogl will automatically fall back from GLSL to ARBfp
      to fixed functions depending on the level of support of the underlying
      GL implementation.

    » Implement a new design for materials; this allows scaling up the
      number of materials in a scene, and also makes copying materials
      less expensive.

    » Make Cogl materials responsible for depth testing, and add new
      experimental API.

    » Use the (modified) GLU tesselator to draw paths to a vertex buffer
      object instead of using the stencil buffer, or the scanline rasterizer
      on platforms without a stencil buffer.

    » Add ClutterDeformEffect, a base class for effects that deform an
      actor's geometry when painting it; ClutterPageTurnEffect is an
      implementation of a "page curl" deformation using the DeformEffect
      API.

    » Always use scissoring when clipping, to reduce the amount of buffer
      that has to be cleared.

    » Allow ClutterShaderEffect sub-classes to use vertex shaders by setting
      a constructor property; the default remains fragment shader.

    » Remove the button of the press event from the DragAction::drag-begin
      and DragAction::drag-end signals. This is an API break from 1.3.4.

    » Do not promote clipped redraws to full redraws.

    » Improve the consistency of the default state name in ClutterState,
      both in the API and in the serialization format.

    » Fix a rounding error with the Text layout size.

    » Add utility functions for CoglMatrix and CoglColor.

    » Avoid a re-allocation cycle warning when resizing the surface of
      a CairoTexture actor from within the allocate() implementation.

    » Do not add the GL libraries for the EGL X11 backend.

    » Add more checks for size of data passed to the shader types GValue
      functions.

    » Add width and height to the BindConstraint.

    » Parse actions, constraints and effects inside an actor definition
      for ClutterScript.

    » Merge the code of native and x11 backends for EGL into a single
      backend; also allow creating GL context with the EGL backend.

    » Use XSETTINGS to set up the backend configuration options, like
      the font name, resolution, font options and double click options,
      on X11; this also allows ClutterText actors created using the
      default font name to be updated when the font name and options
      change; similarly, this allows ClutterUnits to be updated when
      the screen resolution changes.

    » Implement the texture_from_pixmap extension support inside Cogl
      itself, and unify ClutterX11TexturePixmap and ClutterGLXTexturePixmap.

    » Documentation improvements in the API reference and in the cookbook.

    » Use the -Bsymbolic-functions linker option on supported platforms
      to avoid intra-library PLT jumps.

    » Fix painting transparent stages on X11 using the :use-alpha property
      of ClutterStage.

    » Fix emission of scroll events on Windows.

Clutter 1.3.4 (07/06/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.3.2

    » Add ClutterEffect, a ClutterActorMeta sub-class that affects the
      way an actor paints itself.

        » Clutter provides a base class for effects painting to an
          offscreen buffer, and a base class for effects using the
          GL programmable pipeline (through the GLSL shader language).

        » Clutter also provides some simple, shader-based effects:
          ClutterBlurEffect, ClutterColorizeEffect and
          ClutterDesaturateEffect.

        » Effects can be applied to any actor, and can also be stacked.

    » Add ClutterClickAction, an action that provides "button-like"
      semantics for any ClutterActor.

    » ClutterDragAction now moves the actor to which it has been applied
      by default, using a class handler for the ::drag-motion signal.

    » Add the :pick-with-alpha property to ClutterTexture; this property
      allows using the alpha channel of a texture when picking it.

    » Regenerate the mipmaps on COGL textures when a texture is modified.

    » Documentation and build fixes.

    » Add ActorMeta, a class for run-time composition of actions and
      constraints on a ClutterActor:

        » Add ClutterAction, a class for implementing business logic
          related to event handling.

        » Add ClutterConstraint, a class for implementing business
          logic related to sizing and positioning.

        » ClutterDragAction is an Action sub-class that implements
          signals and properties for dragging actors.

        » ClutterAlignConstraint and ClutterBindConstraint are two
          Constraint sub-classes that allow relative positioning
          with fixed layout managers.

    » Fix compilation on 64bit platforms

    » Fix some races of the Stage resizing on X11

    » Documentation fixes for Cogl: the coverage is now 100%

    » Fix rounding errors in the preferred height of the ClutterText
      actor

    » Remove redundant type checks in clutter_actor_get_paint_opacity()

    » Add support for the GLX_INTEL_swap_event extension; when using this
      extension on GLX the glXSwapBuffers() call becomes non-blocking and
      Clutter will use an event to control the master clock.

    » Improve consistency between ClutterBox and ClutterGroup.

    » On X11, do not set the _NET_WM_PID and WM_TITLE properties on a
      Stage X window if the window was not created by Clutter itself

    » Improve caching of GL constant values

    » Optimize creating sub-textures of sub-textures

    » Various fixes for the atlas and the journal

    » Disable the atlas if FBOs are not supported

Clutter 1.1.10 (09/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.8

    » Fixed a regression in textures that caused all the textures to be
      drawn as white rectangles.

    » Fixed compilation with the Sun C compiler.

    » Use SSE2 instructions to premultiply RGBA images, if available.

    » Improve readability of ClutterActor::raise/::lower warnings.

Clutter 1.1.8 (08/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.6

    » Added ClutterAnimator, a class that allows defining complex
      implicit animations involving multiple actors and states; this
      class is mostly meant to be used through the ClutterScript
      definition format, but it provides a convenience C API for
      easily building animations.

    » New experimental COGL API to expose "hardware" buffers such as PBOs or
      drm surfaces. This API can be used, for instance, to make texture
      uploading faster.

    » Fixed the issues with resizable stages getting a 1x1 window with
      the X11 backends

    » Expose input devices for every event; by default, X11 and Windows
      backends expose the core devices only.

    » Add the ClutterStage:key-focus property, for key focus tracking.

    » Allow setting transformable value types in ClutterAnimation when
      calling clutter_animation_bind() and clutter_animation_update().

    » Delay the creation of the default Stage until clutter_stage_get_default()
      is actually called; this reduces the work of clutter_init().

    » Implement Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Backspace in ClutterText

    » Improve the extendability of CoglTexture with internal backends.

    » Add implicit texture atlasing; Cogl will try to put every texture
      inside the same texture atlas by default, to avoid state changes
      in the driver and (hopefully) improve performance.

    » Fix notification of the cursor and selection changes in ClutterText;
      this improves the usage of Clutter from A11Y toolkits.

    » Do not wait for a frame if the system clock goes backwards.

    » Fix the dirtying of the clip state; this unbreaks cogl_path_fill().

    » Documentation and build fixes.

Clutter 1.1.6 (18/01/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.4

    » Some fixes for the Win32 backend (bug #1905).

    » Profiling support via the UProf library. Configure with
      --enable-profile to get a report after each Clutter application is
      run.

    » Improved conformance tests with coverage reports via gcov.

    » ClutterTexture no longer tries to read back texture data into
      g_malloc'd memory on unrealize (bug #1842).

    » The CGL_• defines from cogl-defines.h have been removed. These
      should not have been used by any applications, but if they were
      being used then please replace them either with the Cogl enums or
      with the appropriate GL_• enum if you are using GL directly.

    » Added a delete-event signal to the stage.

    » Fix for using cogl_rectangle with different texture coordinates
      for multiple layers (bug #1937).

    » Fix for using stencil and depth buffers in FBOs on Intel drivers
      in Mesa (bug #1873).

    » Support for subtitles in ClutterMedia.

    » ClutterGLX will now use an RGB visual by default. For
      applications (and toolkit integration libraries) that want to
      enable the ClutterStage:use-alpha property there is a new
      function: clutter_x11_set_use_argb_visual().

    » Fix ClutterText to allow using Pango markup and attributes in
      the same actor (bug #1940).

Clutter 1.1.4 (03/01/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.2

    » Update the ClutterScript parser to be more resilient, and support
      constructor and ChildMeta properties. The parser also respects the
      order of the properties in the UI definitions when applying them,
      and will apply the properties of an Actor after building the scene
      graph.

    » Simplified the implementation of LayoutManager sub-classes, and added
      support for animating a layout manager.

    » Allow short-circuiting some layout operations by setting a specific
      flag on ClutterActor.

    » Improve caching of the preferred size of a ClutterActor.

    » Allow declaring "internal children" for a ClutterContainer
      implementation: the memory management of these actors will be deferred
      entirely to the Container.

    » Let the ClutterStage honour the :opacity property and the alpha component
      of the stage color. This requires support in the Clutter backend used.

    » Improve Windows and OSX backends.

    » Simplify the feature detection code for OpenGL; this also reduced the
      required OpenGL version to 1.2.

    » Improve the matrix stack handling code. The matrices can be debugged by
      using the COGL_DEBUG environment variable, assuming that Clutter was
      compiled with the right configure-time switch.

    » Improve COGL API for draw buffers, and for offscreen buffer support.

    » Add support for text direction to ClutterActor.

    » Documentation, introspection and build fixes.

Clutter 1.1.2 (23/10/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.0

    » Add ClutterLayoutManager, an abstract proxy class for easily
      writing layout management policies; also add ClutterLayoutMeta,
      a class for storing layout properties.

    » Add ClutterBox, a generic container actor that relies on a
      ClutterLayoutManager instance to manage the layout of its
      children.

    » Add the following layout managers:

      - ClutterFixedLayout - a layout manager implementing the
        policy used by ClutterGroup

      - ClutterBinLayout - a layout manager for packing actors
        as layers inside the same area, with per-actor alignment

      - ClutterFlowLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as
        a reflowing grid

      - ClutterBoxLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as
        a single line

    » Remove the requirement for the backend-specific implementation
      of ClutterStage to be a ClutterActor: a Stage implementation must
      only implement the ClutterStageWindow interface. This cleans up
      the backend code.

    » COGL source tree clean up and rationalization; COGL now
      knows the platform, and not only the driver (GL or GLES) so
      we can migrate part of the low-level backend code from Clutter
      to COGL where it makes sense.

    » Remove code duplication across whole COGL.

    » The GLES 2.0 driver for COGL, and the EGLX backend for Clutter
      have been fixed and confirmed working.

    » Add "dump-pick-buffer" to CLUTTER_DEBUG: this debug options
      dumps the contents of each pick() buffer into a PNG file, for
      debugging purposes.

    » Allow interpolating intervals of ClutterUnits for animating
      unit-based properties.

    » Increase strictness and correctness of the ClutterUnits
      grammar parser.

    » Add GValue transformation functions for ClutterPath to and
      from a string.

    » Fix word movement in ClutterText; implement GObject getter for
      :use-markup; emit notification for :position; decouple the
      :text property from the :use-markup property.

    » Do not queue redraws or relayouts on actors currently being
      destroyed. 

    » Support #rrggbb and #rgb notations for ClutterColor.

    » Multiple bug fixes.

    » Provide _NET_WM_PID on the X11 stage implementation.

    » Documentation and Introspection annotation fixes.

    » Add test units for the ClutterActor size requesition.

    » Build fixes.

    » Use AM_SILENT_RULES if Automake 1.11 is detected, and fall
      back to Shave on older Automake versions.

Clutter 1.0.0 (28/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.8

    » Allow per-stage disabling of motion event throttling; this should allow
      platforms or applications that require all the motion events not for
      drawing purposes to get them exactly like Clutter gets them from the
      windowing system.

    » Various documentation fixes.

    » Add per-word key navigation inside ClutterText.

    » Fix the RGB<->HLS conversion.

    » Various fixes for the OSX backend.

    » Various build-related fixes.

Clutter 0.9.8 (17/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.6

    » Add more introspection annotations for language bindings.

    » Fix a bug in clutter_animation_set_alpha(), which also broke the
      clutter_actor_animate_with_alpha() function.

    » Check if the stage requires a relayout before showing it; this fixes
      a bug in the X11-based backends, especially under compositing window
      managers, where a 640x480 window would flicker before the default
      stage was shown for the first time.

    » Performance fixes for Cogl.

    » Sliced textures were broken by the COGL journalling.

    » Use the redraw cycle when asynchronously loading textures from
      files.

    » Miscellaneous compilation fixes for the OS X and Windows backends.

    » Allow querying from within the paint function of an Actor whether
      the actor is currently being directly painted or by a Clone actor.

    » In the GLX backend, when using the non-implicit sync-to-vblank inside
      glXSwapBuffers(), call glFinish() to avoid potential tearing.

Clutter 0.9.6 (01/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.4:

    » Allow the manipulation of the actor's transformation matrix, so that is
      is possible to apply additional transformations in a way that is
      compatible with the transformations already applied by the scene graph.

    » Fix a race in the X11 backend that happened between resizing the stage
      drawable and the call to glViewport().

    » Merge the cogl-journal-batching branch; this branch implements batching
      the geometry of the elements of the scene graph before sending it to
      OpenGL, thus minimizing the number of state changes and improving the
      overall performance of Clutter-based applications.

    » Add more debugging states for Clutter and COGL, which allow the developer
      to track the state of the journal; to check the VBO fallback paths; to
      disable picking for reliable profiling; to disable software-side matrix
      transformations in favour of the driver/GPU ones.

    » Improve the ability to "break out" of COGL by using gl_begin/gl_end
      semantics; applications that drop into raw GL are, though, ignoring all
      the caching performed by COGL and might incur in performance issues.

    » Fixed the :load-async and :load-data-async properties of Texture by
      removing the unneeded G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT flag.

    » Added an initial migration guide that shows the porting process from
      older releases of Clutter to the 1.0 API; the first chapter deals with
      the migration from ClutterEffect to the new implicit animations API.

    » Fixed MT-safety for the master clock.

Many thanks to:

Clutter 0.9.4 (19/06/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.2:

    » Set the layout height in ClutterText, so that wrapping and ellipsization
      work correctly to fill all the allocated area.

    » Remove all the units-based API, and migrate all the positional and
      dimensional accessors to use floating point values when dealing with
      pixels. All the properties dealing with pixels now that a floating
      point value as well.

    » Add the ability to track wether an actor is going to be painted or not,
      using the "mapped" flag. This also allows Clutter to be more strict
      in the handling of the scenegraph, ensuring correctness and avoiding
      wasting resources on nodes that won't be painted.

    » Add debugging facilities for COGL, similar to those of Clutter; through
      them is also possible to have an on screen debugging mode that shows the
      boundaries of each rectangle sent to the GPU.

    » Rework "units" into real logical distance units that can be converted
      between millimeters, typographic points and ems into pixels.

    » Simplify the Animation class to avoid redundancy and the possibility
      of it going out of sync with the Timeline and Alpha instances it uses.

    » Move every operation into a single "master clock" source that advances
      the timelines, dispatches events and redraws the stages in a predictable
      sequence, thus avoiding unneeded redraws. The default is to follow the
      sync-to-vblank cycle, if it is supported by the drivers.

    » Cache the glyphs geometry into a vertex buffer object to avoid
      resubmitting too much information to the GPU.

    » Rework the behaviour of ClutterModel when a filter is applied.

    » Allow submitting premultiplied texture data; this removes the need
      for unpremultiplying data in CairoTexture.

    » Add a simple API for submitting blending and texture combining modes
      through a string description.

    » Move Timelines to pure time-based objects.

    » Lots of performance improvements.

    » Removal of all the deprecated API.

    » Removal of all the fixed point entry points.

    » Lots of documentation fixes - the coverage is now 99% of the exported
      1600 symbols for Clutter and 80%+ of the 300 exported symbols for COGL.

    » Generate the GObject Introspection data for both Clutter and COGL
      at build time.

    » Build environment fixes.

Clutter 0.9.0 (30/01/2009)
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.8.6 and 0.9.0

   » ClutterText is a new actor allowing text display, text editing
     both in multi-line and single-line modes, and text selection using
     the pointer devices and the keyboard. ClutterText supercedes both
     ClutterLabel and ClutterEntry.
   » ClutterClone is a new actor that allows cloning of other actors,
     both simple and composite. ClutterClone supercedes ClutterCloneTexture.
   » ClutterBindingPool is a new API that allows to easily add key bindings
     to an actor.
   » ClutterAnimation is a new API for implicit animations, similar to
     the tweening API used in toolkits like jQuery, Tween and Flash. This
     new API supercedes the ClutterEffect API.
   » ClutterAlpha uses "animation modes" instead of raw function
     pointers; it is still possible to pass alpha functions. The alpha
     functions provided by Clutter have been removed from the public
     API. It is possible to register global alpha functions and use
     them though a logical id.
   » The interval of the ClutterAlpha:alpha property has been changed
     to a floating point value in the [ -1.0, 2.0 ] range; this allowed
     the addition of "overshooting" easing modes.
   » COGL now supports backface culling.
   » The COGL-based Pango renderer is public API and it is accessible
     to developers. It is also possible to access the PangoContext used
     by Clutter in order to create PangoLayouts to render text.
   » The ClutterFixed API has been moved to COGL.
   » COGL does not depend on Clutter data types anymore.
   » The ClutterMedia interface has been overhauled: implementations
     now must only override the interface properties. The ranges of
     some properties have been changed to normalized values.
   » COGL now exposes only floating point entry points, and reserves
     the eventual conversion to fixed point only when needed. The
     fixed point type and macros are publicly available for developers
     concerned about floating point operations.
   » COGL has a new Vertex Attribues API that allows submitting an
     extensible number of vertex attributes to OpenGL in a way that
     does not require format conversions and allows fast re-use.
   » COGL has a new Material API that decouples paths from fills; it
     is possible to create an arbitrary path and fill it with a COGL
     texture. The Material API also allows setting multiple texture
     layers and defining the blend modes and colors.
   » ClutterTexture has the ability to use a worker thread to asynchronously
     load an image from a file, as long as the GLib threading support has
     been enabled prior to calling clutter_init().
   » Clutter now supports localization of the help output, and it
     also supports globally setting the text direction for non left to
     right locales.
   » ClutterCairoTexture is a new actor that allows using Cairo
     to draw on a ClutterTexture; since Cairo does not have an OpenGL
     backend, the drawing is not hardware accelerated.
   » Clutter has a unit testing suite, based on the GLib unit test
     framework, which can be used to track regressions.
   » A ClutterPath object has been added, and it is used by the
     BehaviourPath. The Path object allows defining paths using a set
     of coordinates and operations. A Path can be "painted" either using
     COGL primitives or using Cairo primitives, allowing an easier way
     to paint non-rectangular shaped actors.
   » ClutterInterval is a simple object, used by ClutterAnimation, that
     describes an interval between two values, and interpolates between
     the initial and final values of the interval.

   » Removed the ClutterBackend::get_display_size() and wrappers.

   » Verify that the vertex shaders are successfully compiled when binding
     them.

   » Increase safety of the ClutterGLXTexturePixmap

 • List of bugs fixed since 0.7.4

   » #993 - Underline colors are sometimes wrong

Clutter 0.7.4 (25/06/2008), "Killer Koi"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.7.2 and 0.7.4

   » Fix the ClutterEntry actor after the clip API changes in COGL.

   » Update the shaders generated for GLES 2.0.

   » Add the ability to add search paths and look up files from
     ClutterScript. This allows defining directories to store the
     images to be loaded by a ClutterTexture.

   » Warn if no usable pointer device are available on X11 backends.

   » Improve the request for the best pixel format on win32.

   » Fix a regression when sizing the ClutterStage on backends that
     only support fixed size stages; now setting any size will result
     in Clutter ignoring the request, like it happened in Clutter 0.6.

   » Add a method to ClutterBackend to retrieve the display size.

   » Fix clutter_sinx() for angles > CFX_2PI - CFX_ONE.

 • List of bugs fixed

Clutter 0.7.2 (23/06/2008), "Kedoke"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.7.0 and 0.7.2

   » ClutterTexture has a new :keep-aspect-ratio property; when it is set
     to TRUE the texture will return a preferred width maintaining the
     aspect ratio with the given height and a preferred height maintaining
     the aspect ratio with the given width. This allows to set the width or
     the height and have the texture automatically request the height or the
     width respectively while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original
     image.

   » Added XINPUT support on the X11 backends; this provides an initial
     support for multiple input devices. The API is X11-specific, and
     provides support for querying at run-time support for XINPUT, for
     getting a list of input devices and for getting the type of each
     input device. 
 
   » The 'fruity' backend also features multiple device support.

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #816 - clutter_actor_request_coords() should take a const box.

Clutter 0.7.0 (13/06/2008), "Booska"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.6 and 0.7.0

   » COGL, the underlying GL abstraction layer in Clutter, has been
     completely rewritten from the ground up. Its no longer a conceptual
     hack but a documented, fully featured library pretty much in its
     own right. COGL abstracts over Open GL, Open GL ES 1.1 and now
     OpenGL ES 2.0, providing a smart uniform API over these libraries
     with various utility features such as texture tiling abstractions,
     paths and primitive rendering, FBO, shaders, etc.

   » Clutter now provides an experimental backend for the Apple(tm)
     iPhone and iPod Touch families of products.

   » The Windows platform is now natively supported instead of
     relying on the SDL libraries. The win32 backend is still
     experimental.

   » The X11 based backends now feature support for Actors that wrap
     external X drawables (i.e the texture-from-pixmap extension and
     fallbacks)

   » Clutter now seamlessly supports multiple stages on the backends
     that allow this feature.

   » The custom Pango renderer has been completely rewritten, now using
     the more modern and maintained PangoCairo (instead of FT2), and avoids
     nasty subclassing hacks, supports smooth fast scaling of text, has
     many edge case issues fixed and it still is very efficient (using
     a texture glyph cache). It is even a little bit faster.

   » Better texture support, timeline improvements, ClutterLabel and
     ClutterEntry improvements, and container child properties are among
     the new features - too many to fit in the NEWS file.

Clutter 0.6.0 (18/02/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.6 and 0.6.0

   » New documentation sections inside the API reference, describing
     the animation framework.

   » New API in ClutterActor for computing the actor's vertices in
     the plane of a given ancestor and accessors to query whether an
     actor is scaled or rotated

 • List of bug fixed

   » #613 - Extend point transformation API
   » #779 - Rounding error in ClutterBehaviourScale [Havoc Pennington]
   » #787 - tiled textures are broken
   » #796 - segmentation fault when setting label text

Clutter 0.5.6 (11/02/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.4 and 0.5.6

   » Reverted a last minute change in the depth sorting function of
     ClutterGroup.

   » Added the clutter_actor_move_anchor_point() family of functions,
     which will set the anchor point at the given coordinates while
     adjusting the actor postion so that the relative position of the
     actor toward its parent remains the same.

   » Provide a fallback for finding the Clutter alpha functions inside
     a UI definition for ClutterScript in case g_module_open() fails.

   » Add initial Frame Buffer Objects support in ClutterTexture; using
     FBOs, where supported by the hardware and drivers, it's possible to
     create a ClutterTexture from any actor.

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #386 - Stage is white unless a timeline is present

Clutter 0.5.4 (25/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.2 and 0.5.4

   » A clutter-x11-<major>.<minor> pkg-config file is installed along
     with the clutter-<major>.<minor> and clutter-<backend>-<major>.<minor>
     ones, for libraries and applications depending on the X11-based
     backends (GLX and EGLX).

   » Textures are correctly unrealized before changing and freeing the
     main GL context.

   » It is now possible to block the automatic call to clutter_main_quit()
     when closing the stage window using the frame controls by connecting
     an handler for the ::event signal on the Clutter stage and checking
     for the CLUTTER_DELETE event type and returning TRUE. This allows
     the usage of other main loops with GLib reactors (like Python's twisted)
     with Clutter without triggering assertions by closing the stage window.

Clutter 0.5.2 (14/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.2

   » ClutterModelDefault has been renamed to ClutterListModel

   » ClutterModel now has vector-based variants for append, prepend and
     insert methods; these methods are useful for bindings

   » Add units-based variant for clutter_actor_move_by()

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #694 - Handle GLhandleARB on OS X [Tommi Komulainen]
   » #700 - Fix for clutter_effect_rotate() [Neil Roberts]

Clutter 0.5.0 (02/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0

   » New event handling system: every actor with the CLUTTER_ACTOR_REACTIVE
     flag set will receive events from the underlying backend; the event
     propagation chain will be walked in two directions (from the actor to
     the top-level container and back) with the ability to block it in
     both phases.

   » ClutterShader, an abstraction over the programmable OpenGL pipeline.

   » ClutterScore, an object for controlling timelines; using a score
     instance is possible to start multiple timelines at once, or start
     a timeline after another has emitted the ::complete signal.

   » ClutterScript, an object for parsing a scene from an external file or
     a buffer; the scene is described using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
     every object is defined using its class and properties, and container
     objects can have their children defined as well. It is also possible
     do describe top-level objects such as timelines and behaviours, and to
     automatically connect signal handlers to signal names.

   » ClutterTimelines duration can now be set in milliseconds using the
     :duration property; the default framerate will be used to compute the
     actual duration in frames. The default framerate will be set by the
     backend, and can be overridden by the application.

   » ClutterTimelines direction can now be set using the :direction
     property; a timeline can be set to proceed forward or backward,
     and the direction can also be change while the timeline is still
     running.

   » New, experimental OSX backend.

   » Build environment for MS VisualStudio 2005.

   » ClutterModel, a generic list-based model object that can be used to
     implement actors following the Model-Viewer-Controller design pattern.
     Clutter provides a default implementation of ClutterModel, called
     ClutterModelDefault and using the GSequence data structure from GLib
     to optimize insertion and look up.

   » Add the ability to grab pointer and keyboard events: if an actor
     is set to have a grab it'll be the only one receiving events until
     it releases the grab.

   » Add the ability for an actor to receive the key focus; an actor
     with key focus will always receive the key events, even if it did
     not acquire the keyboard grab.

   » It is now possible to set the GL "fog" (also known as "depth cueing")
     effect on the ClutterStage; if the fog is enabled, actors farther
     away from the view point will fade into the stage background color.

   » Each actor now has an "anchor point", a point defined in the actor's
     coordinate space that will be used as the origin when scaling and
     rotation transformations.

   » Every pixel-based API has been doubled with a corresponding
     ClutterUnits-based function (postfixed with a '-u'), for instance:

       clutter_actor_set_position() - clutter_actor_set_positionu()
       clutter_actor_set_size()     - clutter_actor_set_sizeu()
       clutter_actor_set_depth()    - clutter_actor_set_depthu()

     This allows sub-pixel precision and device independence.

   » The ClutterLabel actor now tries very hard to provide a sane
     default size, if no bounding box has been requested; this fixes
     the :alignment property and allows the addition of the :justify
     property.

   » The SDL backend can now be compiled under win32 with MingW; this
     backend is still marked as experimental.

   » The OSX backend allows the compilation of Clutter under OS X; this
     backend is experimental.

 • List of changes between 0.3.1 and 0.4.0

   » Many documentation additions and improvements.

   » Display DPI now honours on backends its can be queried.

   » Various big endian related fixes.

   » ClutterBehaviourEllipse and ClutterBehaviourRotate API and
   internals improvements.

   » Add basic tslib support to eglnative backend (for touchscreen events)

   » clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos should now work on 16bpp displays.

   » New ClutterEffect rotation calls.

   » Allowing user resizing of the stage now optional.
    (implemented by glx backend only currently)

   » ClutterEntry UTF8 fixes and improved automatic initial sizing.

   » Make ClutterActor GInitiallyUnowned.

   » New ClutterBox API: each box has now a colour and a margin (distance
     between the inner-border and the children); plus, each packed child
     has a padding. Margins and paddings are expressed in ClutterUnits,
     to ease the transition to the device independent units. You can use
     clutter_box_set_default_padding() if you want the same padding for
     each child.

Clutter 0.3.1 (06/07/2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1
   » EGL. There are now 2 experimental EGL backends;
     - 'eglx', the former EGL on X11 implementation (now renamed)
     - 'eglnative', a new EGL 'native' backend which supporting non
       X11 EGL implementations (i.e framebuffer).

   » ClutterGroup now returns correct size when a child is removed.

Clutter 0.3 (29/06/2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.2.3 and 0.3
   » Clutter now supports both switchable windowing system and GL backends.
     Window systems supported include GLX, EGL and SDL.

     GL support includes OpenGL 1.2+ and OpenGL ES 1.1. This is
     provided by a small basic abstraction layer 'cogl.h'. Cogl is not
     yet documented - usage external to Clutter is not yet advised.

     Backends may provide specific command line options.

     Notes;

     GLX
     ---
     The GLX backend is built by default and is currently the most
     developed, supported and featured windowing system backend. Only
     OpenGL is supported via GLX.

     SDL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using SDL. Open GL is supported as
     is OpenGL ES via Dogles (very experimental).

     EGL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using EGL. Only Open GL ES
     is supported by EGL.

     EGL support assumes an EGL implementation running atop X Windows.

     Open GL ES.
     -----------

     Clutter now has experimental support for Open GL ES.
     Current known issues;

     + Unrealising a ClutterTexture will not move pixel data from video
       into system memory but simply destroy it.
     + BGRA, YUV Texture data not currently supported.

     (Use the clutter_feature API to probe for above at runtime)

     Open Source ES implementations this has been tested against
     include `Vincent' and `dgles'.  Support for commerical
     implementations may require modifications to the configure.ac
     script.

              (Also see: http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/ogles/ )

     dgles: http://developer.hybrid.fi/dgles/index.html

   » New ClutterEffect class provides a simplified (and thus less flexible)
     API wrapping around behaviours, alphas and timelines.
   » New Behaviours - bspline, ellipsis, rotation.
   » New built in Alpha functions;
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_HALF
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SQUARE

   » New Clutter_actor •project API calls allow for querying of tranformed
     actor vertices and points.
   » New Clutter Feature checks.

   » Implement Gravity for ClutterScaleBehaviour. [Matthew, Rob]

Clutter 0.2.2 (2007-03-22)
==========================

 • List of changed between 0.2.1 and 0.2.2
   » Addition of basic XEMBED support for clutter stage. [Matthew]
   » Fixes to clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   » Export clutter_group_remove_all and add associated fixes. [Matthew]

Clutter 0.2.1 (2007-02-07)
==========================

 • List of changed between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
   » Add even faster double to integer (and back) conversion
     functions. [Tomas]
   » Fix some errors in the fixed point sine waveform
     function. [Tomas]
   » Use fixed point math in the Pango renderer. [Tomas]
   » Improve the GL version check. [Matthew]
   » Add a square waveform function. [Emmanuele]
 • List of bugs fixed
   » #215 - macro CLUTTER_MARK() not disabled for non-debug builds

Clutter 0.2 (18-01-2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   » Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   » Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   » Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   » Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   » Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   » Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   » Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage.
   » Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   » Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   » Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   » Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.
 • List of bug fixed

 • First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 • Contains:
   » Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   » Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.

   » Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   » An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   » Fairly complete Python bindings.
   » Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
