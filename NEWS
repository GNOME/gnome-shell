 Thanks to David Santiago, Julien Olivier, Anders Carlsson, Rob Adams
 for fixes in this release.

 - improved wording/UI for some dialogs

   the button such that releasing the mouse button won't activate 
   the window button, visually indicate by "popping out" the button.

   mode" if you open a new window while showing desktop, rather 
   than previous behavior of simply leaving show desktop mode.

   just moves the window.

   in zillions of menus

 - reduce latency of managing new windows still further 
   by using async properties code in more places

2.4.13
===

 - we were making all dialogs skip the taskbar, even non-transient 
   ones, though this was supposedly fixed a while ago. Now really
   fixed.
 - change back to Alt+click by default for the window drag feature.
 - assign Alt+F12 to shade window
 - fix not deleting enough workspaces when the number 
   was reduced via the pager config dialog (readams@hmc.edu)
 - don't allow windows under the top panel ever, even if they 
   are tall windows (Arvind)
 - fix up the window layout for directional workspace nav, 
   so you always stop at the edges and always end up 
   where you expect (hp, with tweaks from readams@hmc.edu)
 - focus new windows in mouse focus mode (readams@hmc.edu)
 - support xeyes, oclock, etc. by applying shape mask 
   to the window manager frame (yeah it resizes slow, deal)
 - fix vertical/horizontal maximize
 - handle crossing events resizing for more opaque resize goodness
   (Soeren)
 - add wacky _METACITY_UPDATE_COUNTER experimental extension 
   to do nice opaque resizing (does nothing without a GTK patch)
