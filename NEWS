Cogl 1.9.2                                                         2011-11-23

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.8.0

  » Fix a crash while generating ARBfp code with layers containing a
    NULL texture.
  » Improvements to the mingw-fetch-dependencies script to work
    without first needing to find a copy of config.guess.
  » Translation updates.
  » Ported more conformance tests from Clutter to be standalone Cogl tests.
  » Adds experimental support for EXT_discard_framebuffer extension which
    is important for good performance on PowerVR graphics hardware
  » Adds experimental API to enable clipping to the silhouette of an arbitrary
    2D CoglPrimitive
  » Make the CoglTexture2DSliced API directly available as experimental API
  » Adds a new feature checking API that's not limited to just 32 features
    and also must be passed a CoglContext pointer so it's clear at what point
    the features can start to be queried.
  » Adds an experimental CoglMetaTexture interface that gives one simple
    api for mapping meta-textures that aren't directly understood by the GPU
    (such as sliced textures, atlas textures, sub textures) into low level
    textures. This interface also gives us a single place to handle repeat
    mode fallbacks, supporting clamp-to-edge, repeat and mirrored repeat.
  » Make the CoglTextureRectangle API directly available as experimental API
  » Adds experimental support for multisampling, which is where the gpu
    calculates multiple samples per pixel and the final pixel is a weighted
    average of those samples.  For example you can expect that multisampling
    with 4 samples per pixel would give similar quality to rendering at double
    the resolution and then scaling that image down with texture filtering, but
    the GPU can often do some tricks such that multisampling is faster than
    doing that manually (known as supersampling)
  » Make the CoglSubTexture API directly available as experimental API
  » Added an n_indices argument to cogl_primitive_set_indices to avoid needing
    to always call cogl_primitive_set_n_vertices() after using the api and
    to make it less error prone to use the api.
  » Ship a standalone cogl-xlib.h that must be included manually for any xlib
    specific api because the Xlib headers so many numerous badly namespaced
    symbols that it's not desireable to include them unless absolutely
    required.
  » Updated the Wayland support to work with the latest upstream interfaces.
  » Add experimental CoglPipeline API for controlling the backface culling.
  » Added a cogl_matrix_transpose() function
  » Add experimental support for setting uniforms on a CoglPipeline. This
    is in preparation for being able to associate snippets of GLSL that hook
    into specific parts of the pipeline. We plan to eventually deprecate
    CoglProgram but even in the meantime we would also recommend setting
    uniforms on the pipeline now instead of the program.
  » Adds experimental cogl_framebuffer_finish() api for explicitly synchonizing
    the GPU with the CPU.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.8

  » Started porting Cogl conformance tests from Clutter to be standalone
    Cogl tests including tests for depth-state and backface culling.
  » Added a new color mask conformance test
  » We no longer implicitly define COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_2_0_API in the
    cogl-2.0-experimental.pc file cflags because the way pkgconfig works makes
    it hard to then consume libraries depending on cogl-2.0-experimental.pc
    with Clutter.
  » Made progress re-factoring cogl-pipeline.c to be more maintainable by
    starting to split the code up into more manageable pieces.
  » We now bind the locale dir for the Cogl domain during init
  » We now track backface culling state as part of CoglPipeline.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.6

   » Getters for the display and renderer associated with context
   » Getter for the number of supported texture units during fragment
     processing. (ClutterGst needs to know this for example to know if GLSL
     based YUV->RGB color space conversion can be used.)
   » Optimizations for the GLSL codegen for fragment processing so we can
     ignore redundant layers - if for example the "REPLACE" function is used
     for layer N then computing anything for previous layers is redundant. Also
     if texture combining needs to sample the same texture multiple times we
     now re-use the same sample instead of repeating it.
   » Optimize texture uploads to a texture atlas on GLES by avoiding lots of
     redundant format conversions.
   » Relax the requirement to need braces around blend factors when using the
     CoglBlendString syntax. Braces are only needed for factors involving a
     subtraction like "(1 - SRC_COLOR[A])"
   » Adds API for querying the format of a CoglFramebuffer

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.2

   » Optimize pipeline unparent operation using embedded lists instead
     of using GList API.
   » Remove the old matrix operation code we had before pulling in the
     mesa based code, and flatten all our matrix utilities back into one
     maintainable file.
   » Expose cogl_framebuffer_get_red/green/blue/alpha bits to query
     the precision for a framebuffer's color channels.
   » Numerous reference manual updates
   » Fix some memory leaks in CoglPipeline that weren't captured in
     bugzilla.
   » Fix some EGL winsys issues that weren't captured in bugzilla.
   » Switch to dynamically loading libGL, libGLESv2 or libGLES[v1]_CM
     at runtime so it's possible to distribute a libcogl that can choose
     to work with any of these at runtime. This can simplify packaging
     on distros that have numerous packages that provide a platform
     specific GL/GLES driver and certainly helps during the development
     process when evaluating the pros-and-cons of different drivers for
     a given platform.
   » Clean up lots of inconsistencies with platform specific APIs, so
     we follow the naming convention of cogl_<platform>_object_method.
   » Remove cogl_set_default_context from experimental 2.0 api, since
     we are aiming to remove the default context for 2.0
   » Ensure the experimental 2.0 reference manual gets a unique
     DOC_MODULE name so that distro's trying to package cogl don't end
     up installing the 1.x and 2.0 manuals to the same location
   » Add a program cache for the GLSL backend, a bit like we have for
     the ARBfp backend. This can be a big boost in performance for some
     apps depending on your platform.
   » Adds dither_enable getter and setter API for CoglFramebuffer so
     that Clutter doesn't need to use the GL API directly when picking.
     We need to get to the point where Clutter doesn't need to link
     against libGL directly so Clutter can take advantage of runtime
     driver selection by Cogl.
   » Use MESA_pack_invert extension in cogl_read_pixels to avoid
     needing to manually flip pixel data read in bottom-up order to a
     top-down order.
   » Fix the hello example to actually clear the framebuffer at the
     start of the frame instead of unintentionally relying on the driver
     to have cleared the framebuffer.
