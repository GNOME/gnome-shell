Clutter 0.7.2 (23/06/2008), "Kedoke"
===============================================================================

 * List of changes between 0.7.0 and 0.7.2

   o ClutterTexture has a new :keep-aspect-ratio property; when it is set
     to TRUE the texture will return a preferred width maintaining the
     aspect ratio with the given height and a preferred height maintaining
     the aspect ratio with the given width. This allows to set the width or
     the height and have the texture automatically request the height or the
     width respectively while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original
     image.

   o Added XINPUT support on the X11 backends; this provides an initial
     support for multiple input devices. The API is X11-specific, and
     provides support for querying at run-time support for XINPUT, for
     getting a list of input devices and for getting the type of each
     input device. 
 
   o The 'fruity' backend also features multiple device support.

Clutter 0.7.0 (13/06/2008), "Booska"
===============================================================================

 * List of changes between 0.6 and 0.7.0

   o COGL, the underlying GL abstraction layer in Clutter, has been
     completely rewritten from the ground up. Its no longer a conceptual
     hack but a documented, fully featured library pretty much in its
     own right. COGL abstracts over Open GL, Open GL ES 1.1 and now
     OpenGL ES 2.0, providing a smart uniform API over these libraries
     with various utility features such as texture tiling abstractions,
     paths and primitive rendering, FBO, shaders, etc.

   o Clutter now provides an experimental backend for the Apple(tm)
     iPhone and iPod Touch families of products.

   o The Windows platform is now natively supported instead of
     relying on the SDL libraries. The win32 backend is still
     experimental.

   o The X11 based backends now feature support for Actors that wrap
     external X drawables (i.e the texture-from-pixmap extension and
     fallbacks)

   o Clutter now seamlessly supports multiple stages on the backends
     that allow this feature.

   o The custom Pango renderer has been completely rewritten, now using
     the more modern and maintained PangoCairo (instead of FT2), and avoids
     nasty subclassing hacks, supports smooth fast scaling of text, has
     many edge case issues fixed and it still is very efficient (using
     a texture glyph cache). It is even a little bit faster.

   o Better texture support, timeline improvements, ClutterLabel and
     ClutterEntry improvements, and container child properties are among
     the new features - too many to fit in the NEWS file.

   o New documentation sections inside the API reference, describing
     the animation framework.

   o New API in ClutterActor for computing the actor's vertices in
     the plane of a given ancestor and accessors to query whether an
     actor is scaled or rotated

 * List of bug fixed

   o #613 - Extend point transformation API
   o #779 - Rounding error in ClutterBehaviourScale [Havoc Pennington]
   o #787 - tiled textures are broken
   o #796 - segmentation fault when setting label text

Clutter 0.5.6 (11/02/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.4 and 0.5.6

   o Reverted a last minute change in the depth sorting function of
     ClutterGroup.

   o Added the clutter_actor_move_anchor_point() family of functions,
     which will set the anchor point at the given coordinates while
     adjusting the actor postion so that the relative position of the
     actor toward its parent remains the same.

   o Provide a fallback for finding the Clutter alpha functions inside
     a UI definition for ClutterScript in case g_module_open() fails.

   o Add initial Frame Buffer Objects support in ClutterTexture; using
     FBOs, where supported by the hardware and drivers, it's possible to
     create a ClutterTexture from any actor.

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #386 - Stage is white unless a timeline is present
   o #439 - timing related pong lockup due to timeline rewind...
   o #440 - 1 pixel line flickering
   o #442 - Shader support

Clutter 0.5.4 (25/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.2 and 0.5.4

   o A clutter-x11-<major>.<minor> pkg-config file is installed along
     with the clutter-<major>.<minor> and clutter-<backend>-<major>.<minor>
     ones, for libraries and applications depending on the X11-based
     backends (GLX and EGLX).

   o Textures are correctly unrealized before changing and freeing the
     main GL context.

   o It is now possible to block the automatic call to clutter_main_quit()
     when closing the stage window using the frame controls by connecting
     an handler for the ::event signal on the Clutter stage and checking
     for the CLUTTER_DELETE event type and returning TRUE. This allows
     the usage of other main loops with GLib reactors (like Python's twisted)
     with Clutter without triggering assertions by closing the stage window.

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #564 - Add more precise clutter_qdivx() [Gwenole Beauchesne]
   o #614 - ClutterActor API inconsistencies

     API change [Josh Stewart]

Clutter 0.5.2 (14/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.2

   o ClutterModelDefault has been renamed to ClutterListModel

   o ClutterModel now has vector-based variants for append, prepend and
     insert methods; these methods are useful for bindings

   o Add units-based variant for clutter_actor_move_by()

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #694 - Handle GLhandleARB on OS X [Tommi Komulainen]
   o #700 - Fix for clutter_effect_rotate() [Neil Roberts]

Clutter 0.5.0 (02/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0

   o New event handling system: every actor with the CLUTTER_ACTOR_REACTIVE
     flag set will receive events from the underlying backend; the event
     propagation chain will be walked in two directions (from the actor to
     the top-level container and back) with the ability to block it in
     both phases.

   o ClutterShader, an abstraction over the programmable OpenGL pipeline.

   o ClutterScore, an object for controlling timelines; using a score
     instance is possible to start multiple timelines at once, or start
     a timeline after another has emitted the ::complete signal.

   o ClutterScript, an object for parsing a scene from an external file or
     a buffer; the scene is described using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
     every object is defined using its class and properties, and container
     objects can have their children defined as well. It is also possible
     do describe top-level objects such as timelines and behaviours, and to
     automatically connect signal handlers to signal names.

   o ClutterTimelines duration can now be set in milliseconds using the
     :duration property; the default framerate will be used to compute the
     actual duration in frames. The default framerate will be set by the
     backend, and can be overridden by the application.

   o ClutterTimelines direction can now be set using the :direction
     property; a timeline can be set to proceed forward or backward,
     and the direction can also be change while the timeline is still
     running.

   o New, experimental OSX backend.

   o Build environment for MS VisualStudio 2005.

   o ClutterModel, a generic list-based model object that can be used to
     implement actors following the Model-Viewer-Controller design pattern.
     Clutter provides a default implementation of ClutterModel, called
     ClutterModelDefault and using the GSequence data structure from GLib
     to optimize insertion and look up.

   o Add the ability to grab pointer and keyboard events: if an actor
     is set to have a grab it'll be the only one receiving events until
     it releases the grab.

   o Add the ability for an actor to receive the key focus; an actor
     with key focus will always receive the key events, even if it did
     not acquire the keyboard grab.

   o It is now possible to set the GL "fog" (also known as "depth cueing")
     effect on the ClutterStage; if the fog is enabled, actors farther
     away from the view point will fade into the stage background color.

   o Each actor now has an "anchor point", a point defined in the actor's
     coordinate space that will be used as the origin when scaling and
     rotation transformations.

   o Every pixel-based API has been doubled with a corresponding
     ClutterUnits-based function (postfixed with a '-u'), for instance:

       clutter_actor_set_position() - clutter_actor_set_positionu()
       clutter_actor_set_size()     - clutter_actor_set_sizeu()
       clutter_actor_set_depth()    - clutter_actor_set_depthu()

     This allows sub-pixel precision and device independence.

   o The ClutterLabel actor now tries very hard to provide a sane
     default size, if no bounding box has been requested; this fixes
     the :alignment property and allows the addition of the :justify
     property.

   o The SDL backend can now be compiled under win32 with MingW; this
     backend is still marked as experimental.

   o The OSX backend allows the compilation of Clutter under OS X; this
     backend is experimental.

     has a padding. Margins and paddings are expressed in ClutterUnits,
     to ease the transition to the device independent units. You can use
     clutter_box_set_default_padding() if you want the same padding for
     each child.

Clutter 0.3 (29/06/2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2.3 and 0.3
   o Clutter now supports both switchable windowing system and GL backends.
     Window systems supported include GLX, EGL and SDL.

     GL support includes OpenGL 1.2+ and OpenGL ES 1.1. This is
     provided by a small basic abstraction layer 'cogl.h'. Cogl is not
     yet documented - usage external to Clutter is not yet advised.

     Backends may provide specific command line options.

     Notes;

     GLX
     ---
     The GLX backend is built by default and is currently the most
     developed, supported and featured windowing system backend. Only
     OpenGL is supported via GLX.

     SDL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using SDL. Open GL is supported as
     is OpenGL ES via Dogles (very experimental).

     EGL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using EGL. Only Open GL ES
     is supported by EGL.

     EGL support assumes an EGL implementation running atop X Windows.

     Open GL ES.
     -----------

     Clutter now has experimental support for Open GL ES.
     Current known issues;

     + Unrealising a ClutterTexture will not move pixel data from video
       into system memory but simply destroy it.
     + BGRA, YUV Texture data not currently supported.

     (Use the clutter_feature API to probe for above at runtime)

     Open Source ES implementations this has been tested against
     include `Vincent' and `dgles'.  Support for commerical
     implementations may require modifications to the configure.ac
     script.

     vincent: http://ogl-es.sourceforge.net/
              (Also see: http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/ogles/ )

     dgles: http://developer.hybrid.fi/dgles/index.html

   o New ClutterEffect class provides a simplified (and thus less flexible)
     API wrapping around behaviours, alphas and timelines.
   o New Behaviours - bspline, ellipsis, rotation.
   o New built in Alpha functions;
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_HALF
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SQUARE
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_DEC
   o New Actors and interfaces
     + ClutterLayout, for writing extended layout support in actors
     + ClutterContainer, for generic container actors
     + ClutterBox, ClutterVBox and ClutterHBox layout actors.

Clutter 0.2.3 (2007-04-11)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.2 and 0.2.3
   o Fixes to tile based textures and again clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Implement Gravity for ClutterScaleBehaviour. [Matthew, Rob]

Clutter 0.2.2 (2007-03-22)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.1 and 0.2.2
   o Addition of basic XEMBED support for clutter stage. [Matthew]
   o Fixes to clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Export clutter_group_remove_all and add associated fixes. [Matthew]

Clutter 0.2.1 (2007-02-07)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
   o Add even faster double to integer (and back) conversion
     functions. [Tomas]
   o Fix some errors in the fixed point sine waveform
     function. [Tomas]
   o Use fixed point math in the Pango renderer. [Tomas]
   o Improve the GL version check. [Matthew]
   o Add a square waveform function. [Emmanuele]
 * List of bugs fixed
   o #215 - macro CLUTTER_MARK() not disabled for non-debug builds

Clutter 0.2 (18-01-2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   o Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   o Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   o Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   o Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   o Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   o Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   o Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage.
   o Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   o Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   o Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   o Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.
 * List of bug fixed
   o #199 - Little group handling fix?
   o #198 - Detect NPOT support on more systems
   o #197 - Tiled textures are broken
   o #196 - Rebuild the examples when the library changes
   o #156 - clutter_actor_set_position not using the absolute size
   o #155 - Don't test for XInitThreads [Bastien Nocera]
   o #154 - Key presses not working in super-oh example [Bastien Nocera]
   o #152 - Misc fixes [Bastien Nocera]
   o #143 - Faulty ref-counting in clutter_group_remove [Frederic Riss]
   o #141 - Copy-pasto in clutter_media_set_volume [Frederic Riss]
   o #101 - No package 'x11' found -- wrong configure [Tomasz Torcz]
   o  #98 - Enabling trails in super-oh crashes

Clutter 0.1 (22/06/2006)
========================

 * First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 * Contains:
   o Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   o Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   o Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable.
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 * If you want to help out see the TODO file.
