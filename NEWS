  • List of changes since Cogl 1.16.0

  » Textures are now allocated lazily. This means the textures can
    optionally be configured with extra API before data is uploaded to
    them.
  » The internal format for textures has been replaced with a simpler
    property to just set the number of components that will be
    required when sampling.
  » Depth writing can now be disabled per-framebuffer as well as on
    the CoglPipeline.
  » The interface typedefs such as CoglTexture, CoglFramebuffer and
    CoglBitmap etc are now defined as void so that it is no longer
    necessary to use type-cast macros when passing them to interface
    methods.
  » YV12/I420 support in cogl-gst is fixed.
  » Added support for red-green 2-component textures.
  » The cache of GLSL shaders is now garbage collected when it gets
    too large.
  » cogl_framebuffer_push_path_clip is fixed.
  » cogl-path is now split out into a separate library.
  » New function cogl_wayland_texture_set_region_from_shm_buffer to
    update a texture from a Wayland SHM bufffer.
  » The pkg-config files for cogl-gst and cogl-gles2 have new more
    consistent names.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.15.8

  » Added API to set the onscreen template on a CoglDisplay outside of
    the constructor.
  » Added public API to configure the layout of displays when using
    the KMS winsys.
  » Added a cogl_point_coord builtin variable for snippets which can
    be used to render point sprites in more dynamic ways.
  » cogl_texture_new_with_size now returns NULL on failure. This
    behaviour was accidentally changed in 1.14.0.
  » Fixed a problem with setting the precision specifiers on GLES2
    which was causing a lot of problems with the latest Mesa.
  » Added a “webgl” driver to manage the differences in GLES2 when
    compiling with emscripten.
  » Fixed a bug with paths which was causing Clutter's texture-fbo
    test to crash.
  » Some issues with introspecting the cogl-pango API were fixed.
  » Added an example using point sprites.
  » Build fixes for building with MinGW32.
  » Updates to the MSVC build files.
  » Documentation fixes to the snippets API.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.15.6

  Brown bag release to fix a problem with including cogl-path.h from
  cogl.h that meant only code defining
  COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_2_0_API would get access to the CoglPath
  API.

  We now ignore whether COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_2_0_API is defined so
  clutter which does define it will see the api and so will clutter
  users that don't define it.

Cogl 1.15.6                                                        2013-08-19

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.15.4

  » Fixed runtime selection of egl-kms backend
  » Split out the CoglPath api in-line with cogl master to reduce
    divergence, but updated to not break the 1.x API/ABI
  » Reverted the semantic change to cogl_offscreen_new_to_texture to
    make it synchronously allocate as it did in cogl-1.14. A
    replacement cogl_offscreen_new_with_texture api has been
    introduced to support the asynchronous allocation behaviour
    required to allow configuration of a framebuffer before
    allocation.
  » Fixed a problem with binding attribute locations with desktop GL
    drivers, required to work with the latest Mesa.
  » Some configure.ac documentation fixes
  » In cogl-gst we make sure to only emit the "pipeline-ready" signal
    once the new textures have actually been uploaded.
  » Various MSVC build fixes

  Note: we took some care to try and avoid breaking the ABI and
  chaning the soname relative to the last 1.15.4 snapshot.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.15.2

  » Added experimental API to directly expose atlas textures.
  » Added new_from_file/data/bitmap APIs for sliced textures.
  » Added new_from_file APIs for 2D textures.
  » Added cogl_primitive_draw as a new name for the
    cogl_framebuffer_draw_primitive function.
  » Removed the attribute drawing APIs. Instead applications should
    create a primitive and draw that.
  » Fixed bug where Cogl would busy-wait with 100% CPU if the Wayland
    compositor is closed.
  » The COGL_FRAME_EVENT_SYNC events are now sent based on the frame
    callback with the Wayland backend.
  » New cogl_gst_video_sink_is_ready() function to determine whether a
    Cogl-GST video sink is ready to have the pipeline queried.
  » Fixed a potential bug with the blending enabled state when copying
    a pipeline.
  » Fixed detecting the Mesa vendor when GL 3 is used.
  » Fixed a reference leak on the CoglRenderer.
  » Fixes to the Visual Studio build files.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.14.0

  » Lots of Wayland backend work, including updated compositor support
  » Updated cogland, a simple example wayland compositor using Cogl
  » Made the onscreen resize callback work the same as the frame callback
  » New cogl_onscreen_swap_buffers_with_damage api
  » New fence API
  » New Emscripten support (only basic at the moment)
  » Improved blend state tracking
  » New cogl_onscreen_add_dirty_callback() api for window systems
    that need to notify application of dirty/damaged regions that must
    be redrawn by the application
  » Started adding internal unit tests to complement the conformance
    tests
  » New support for per-vertex point sizes
  » New cogl-gst sub-library added enabling gstreamer integration into
    Cogl based applications. Notably the design is compatible with
    applications adding custom shader snippets to a CoglPipeline that
    handles video sampling so application will be able to chain
    together shader based affects without requiring intermediate
    renderers.
  » Adds HSL color conversion apis
  » The Conformance test suite can now be installed with a .test file
    enabling them to be run by the gnome-desktop-testing-runner for example.

  » Support latest libgbm api

  » Avoid referencing contexts internally so Android
    applications can reliably destroy the resources of a context without
    us needing to introduce api to break internal circular references.
  » More work to reduce our dependence on a global context internally.
  » Recognize the latest Mesa GL vendor strings and the "Software
    Rasterizer" renderer string.
  » Improved cogl-gles2 support by not depending on drivers allowing
    multiple vertex shaders in one program which isn't actually meant
    to be supported in GLES 2.0 anyway. (We were lucky before because
    Mesa happened to allow this but it doesn't work with other vendor
    drivers.)

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.10.0

  » Adds cogl_framebuffer_{fill,stroke}_path APIs consistent with
    other Cogl drawing APIs that replace cogl_path_fill/stroke().
  » Switch from using glib types such as guint32/guint16/guint8 to
    using equivalent stdint.h types.
  » Adds a micro-benchmark for the journal
  » Optimized the matrix stack so we can take immutable references
    of a matrix stack for logging into the journal more efficiently
    than having to copy large matrices for each journaled rectangle.
  » Added COGL_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO} macros and
    COGL_VERSION_CHECK macros for applications to test what version
    of Cogl they are compiled against.
  » Allow creation of non power of two (npot) CoglTexture2D textures
    with only basic npot support, not including repeating or mipmap
    support.
  » Enable use of the GL_STREAM_DRAW buffer update hint on GLES 2.0
  » Fix building Cogl with --disable-gl
  » Added support for the WebOS version of SDL which supports access
    to GLES 1.1 and GLES 2.0
  » Adds cogl_matrix_init_translation to provide a more efficient
    way to initialize a matrix representing a translation without
    need to multiply matrices.
  » Various documentation fixes for CoglQuaternion and CoglEular
  » Updates for the MSVC build
  » Added GPU architecture detection capabilities so we can
    differentiate drivers based on the hardware vendor, and the
    actual architecture of the GPU, such as deferred vs immediate
    mode.
  » Fix framebuffer initialization to ensure swaps are throttled by
    default.
  » Fix flushing of the depth state for some cases.
  » Ported test-atlas-migration to be a standalone Cogl test
  » Added GLES 2.0 API integration support so that existing GLES 2.0
    based code can easily be integrated within Cogl based
    applications.  For example this is being used by webkit-clutter to
    add WebGL support.
  » Added an optional libcogl-gles2 sub-library that provides a full
    GLES 2.0 api api to really lower the barrier as much as possible
    for being able to integrate existing GLES 2.0 based code into
    Cogl applications.
  » Adds a Cogl GLES 2.0 Gears example application to test the GLES
    2.0 integration support.
  » Fix a bug with disabling of Cogl's debugging features.
  » Added api to directly convert a Eular to a Quaternion.
  » Improve the wireframe debug option to work when a vertex shader
    is in use.
  » Added support for SDL2 which supports GLES 2.0
  » Support the original GLSL extensions which had some different
    function names.
  » Avoid using eglGetProcAddress for core symbols which isn't allowed
    by the EGL spec and causes problems on Android.
  » Adds cogl_android_bitmap_new_from_asset() API to load images from
    Android assets.
  » Adds support for resizable onscreen framebuffers.
  » Avoids implicitly including the EGL headers when including cogl.h
  » Adds cogl.conf and environment variables to allow disabling the
    use of specific GL extensions; for example if the implementation
    is known to be buggy on a given system.

    COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API is defined.
  » Add cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels. This is a convenience wrapper
    around cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels_into_bitmap to read directly
    into an application's buffer.
  » Added a public cogl_bitmap_new_for_data function. This can be used
    for example to call cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels_into_bitmap to
    read directly into an application's buffer with an unusual
    rowstride.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.9.6

  » Various Visual Studio build fixes
  » Correctly check for GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil and support using
    GL_OES_packed_depth_stencil on GLES2
  » Correctly handle pre-multiplied alpha conversions when reading
    back texture data.
  » Added cogl_renderer_{get,set}_driver functions so the underlying
    driver can be chosen programmatically.
  » Revamped the conformance testing framework so that it
    automatically runs every test against GLES2 as well as GL and also
    against all of the pipeline backends and with npot textures
    disabled.
  » Add a conformance test for reading back an RGBA texture as
    alpha-only
  » Added support for converting between all of Cogl's supported pixel
    formats including pre-multiplied alpha conversions.
  » Added conformance tests for converting to and from all of the
    supported formats.
  » Added a public cogl_framebuffer_read_pixels_into_bitmap()
    function which will effective read into a CoglPixelBuffer.
  » CoglPixelBuffer was changed to no longer have associated width,
    height and format information and instead we will rely on
    CoglBitmap to track that informations. The relationship is
    analogous how CoglAttributes relate to CoglAttributeBuffers
    and means for example that a CoglPixelBuffer could now be used
    to hold multiple images.
  » Added public cogl_bitmap_get_{width,height,format,rowstride} api
  » Added a public accessor for the underlying pixel buffer of a
    CoglBitmap.
  » Added various missing cast macros for some buffer objects.
  » Ported the Clutter based test-pixel-buffer test to be standalone.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.9.4

  » New conformance tests or tests ported from Clutter:
        test-offscreen
        test-primitive
        test-texture-3d
  » New public experimental functions:
        cogl_pipeline_get_layer_texture
        cogl_primitive_copy
        cogl_primitive_foreach_attribute
        cogl_primitive_get_indices
        cogl_pipeline_get_layer_{min,max}_filter
  » Added cogl_kms_renderer_get_kms_fd to get the KMS file descriptor.
  » Bug fixed in the KMS support where it would crash on cleanup if it
    couldn't save the CRTC state.
  » Bug fixed in the Wayland compositor support where it would leak
    EGLImages when creating a texture from a buffer
  » The swap_buffer callback in GLX is now delayed until
    cogl_poll_dispatch is called so that apps can handle it more
    predictably.
  » Fixes for bugs with pipelines that are trying to use a layer with
    a NULL texture.
  » New cogl_framebuffer_* API for drawing directly to the framebuffer
    without having to push the framebuffer. Ideally we want to move
    towards this style of API in future with no global stacks.
  » Most of the _EXP suffixes have been removed from the experimental
    API symbols in the hope that the gtk-doc unstable annotation will
    be enough to distinguish these.
  » Add a COGL_DEBUG=winsys option
  » CoglBuffer and CoglPrimitive now take an explicit CoglContext
    argument in their constructor. We want to move towards getting rid
    of the global context.
  » Updates to the MSVC build support.
  » Add cogl_pipeline_set_layer_null_texture(). This can be used for
    base pipelines instead of having to create a dummy texture.
  » Fix some bugs where Cogl was assuming there is a direct mapping
    between the pipeline layer number and the GL texture unit number.
  » In snippets, there are now always builtin sampler uniforms for
    every layer of the pipeline. This makes it easier to write GLSL
    that samples arbitrary units.
  » The texture lookup snippet hook now gets passed the sampler for
    the unit. The snippet can use this to sample the texture multiple
    times.
  » Some public constants for CoglPixelFormat have been removed
    (COGL_UNPREMULT_MASK, COGL_UNORDERED_MASK and
    COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_{24,32}).
  » 30-bit pixel formats added.
  » COGL_DEBUG=wireframes now correctly renders primitives using
    vertex shader snippets.
  » cogl_framebuffer_swap_buffers and friends have been renamed to
    cogl_onscreen_swap_buffers.
  » If the experimental 2.0 API is requested, as far as possible the
    headers for the 1.0 API are no longer included. Define
    COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API instead if you want to mix both APIs.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.9.2

  » Visual Studio 2008/2010 project files have landed and are being actively
    maintained by Chun-wei Fan <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>
  » A basic KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) backend was added so we can run fullscreen
    Cogl applications without X11 on Linux.
  » EGL platforms can now be selected at runtime. Although we've had the ability
    select backends at runtime for a while, up until now all EGL platforms were
    part of one monolithic backend and were mutually exclusive so a platform
    had to be chosen at build time.
  » cogl_matrix_orthographic() was added as a replacement for cogl_matrix_ortho()
    since the OpenGL style of arguments for cogl_matrix_ortho() wasn't consistent
    with the rest of the Cogl API.
  » Experimental cogl_framebuffer_ apis were added for manipulating the
    per-framebuffer modelview matrix stack. The aim is for these to replace
    apis like cogl_rotate/translate/scale because those apis aren't explicitly
    related to a CoglContext which we'd like to avoid so we can remove the
    need for a global CoglContext.
  » Experimental cogl_framebuffer apis were added for manipulating the
    per-framebuffer clip stacks.
  » The internal _cogl_framebuffer_flush_state() function was optimized to do
    a better job of bailing out when no framebuffer state has changed, and
    when state has changed the cost should now scale by the number of changes
    made instead of scaling by the total range of framebuffer state that Cogl
    tracks.
  » Internally we finally removed _cogl_enable() which won't mean much to most
    people but makes the maintainers happy. This happened as part of a rework
    for how attribute state is flushed when drawing which fixed some problems
    with supporting custom attributes and should improve the performance of
    flushing attributes too.
  » We added an experimental CoglSnippets api aiming to greatly simplify how
    developers can incorporate snippets of GLSL code into the pipeline. This is
    a feature that has been on the drawing board for a long time so we're
    really happy that it's finally here.

    *** We'd really love to see people start to play with the snippets API and
    tell us how they get on. The plan is for this API to replace all need for
    developers to use the CoglProgram and CoglShader apis which are rather poor
    copies of the OpenGL APIs for using GLSL which don't map well to Cogl's
    design. ***

  » We've updated Cogl's client side Wayland support
  » We've updated Cogl's compositor side Wayland support, including updating the
    example cogland compositor.
  » We added an SDL window system backend for Cogl, which provides a simple,
    portable way to play with Cogl as a standalone graphics API with basic
    support for input events available from SDL. See examples/cogl-sdl-hello
    to see how that works.
  » We added mainloop integration support to Cogl. Since we want to have the
    ability to use poll() to block for events from some drivers we have introduced
    apis that all Cogl applications are required to use to integrate Cogl
    into their mainloop. For applications using a glib mainloop we've provided
    a GSource for convenience.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.8.0

  » Fix a crash while generating ARBfp code with layers containing a
    NULL texture.
  » Improvements to the mingw-fetch-dependencies script to work
    without first needing to find a copy of config.guess.
  » Translation updates.
  » Ported more conformance tests from Clutter to be standalone Cogl tests.
  » Adds experimental support for EXT_discard_framebuffer extension which
    is important for good performance on PowerVR graphics hardware
  » Adds experimental API to enable clipping to the silhouette of an arbitrary
    2D CoglPrimitive
  » Make the CoglTexture2DSliced API directly available as experimental API
  » Adds a new feature checking API that's not limited to just 32 features
    and also must be passed a CoglContext pointer so it's clear at what point
    the features can start to be queried.
  » Adds an experimental CoglMetaTexture interface that gives one simple
    api for mapping meta-textures that aren't directly understood by the GPU
    (such as sliced textures, atlas textures, sub textures) into low level
    textures. This interface also gives us a single place to handle repeat
    mode fallbacks, supporting clamp-to-edge, repeat and mirrored repeat.
  » Make the CoglTextureRectangle API directly available as experimental API
  » Adds experimental support for multisampling, which is where the gpu
    calculates multiple samples per pixel and the final pixel is a weighted
    average of those samples.  For example you can expect that multisampling
    with 4 samples per pixel would give similar quality to rendering at double
    the resolution and then scaling that image down with texture filtering, but
    the GPU can often do some tricks such that multisampling is faster than
    doing that manually (known as supersampling)
  » Make the CoglSubTexture API directly available as experimental API
  » Added an n_indices argument to cogl_primitive_set_indices to avoid needing
    to always call cogl_primitive_set_n_vertices() after using the api and
    to make it less error prone to use the api.
  » Ship a standalone cogl-xlib.h that must be included manually for any xlib
    specific api because the Xlib headers so many numerous badly namespaced
    symbols that it's not desireable to include them unless absolutely
    required.
  » Updated the Wayland support to work with the latest upstream interfaces.
  » Add experimental CoglPipeline API for controlling the backface culling.
  » Added a cogl_matrix_transpose() function
  » Add experimental support for setting uniforms on a CoglPipeline. This
    is in preparation for being able to associate snippets of GLSL that hook
    into specific parts of the pipeline. We plan to eventually deprecate
    CoglProgram but even in the meantime we would also recommend setting
    uniforms on the pipeline now instead of the program.
  » Adds experimental cogl_framebuffer_finish() api for explicitly synchonizing
    the GPU with the CPU.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.8

  » Started porting Cogl conformance tests from Clutter to be standalone
    Cogl tests including tests for depth-state and backface culling.
  » Added a new color mask conformance test
  » We no longer implicitly define COGL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_2_0_API in the
    cogl-2.0-experimental.pc file cflags because the way pkgconfig works makes
    it hard to then consume libraries depending on cogl-2.0-experimental.pc
    with Clutter.
  » Made progress re-factoring cogl-pipeline.c to be more maintainable by
    starting to split the code up into more manageable pieces.
  » We now bind the locale dir for the Cogl domain during init
  » We now track backface culling state as part of CoglPipeline.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.6

   » Getters for the display and renderer associated with context
   » Getter for the number of supported texture units during fragment
     processing. (ClutterGst needs to know this for example to know if GLSL
     based YUV->RGB color space conversion can be used.)
   » Optimizations for the GLSL codegen for fragment processing so we can
     ignore redundant layers - if for example the "REPLACE" function is used
     for layer N then computing anything for previous layers is redundant. Also
     if texture combining needs to sample the same texture multiple times we
     now re-use the same sample instead of repeating it.
   » Optimize texture uploads to a texture atlas on GLES by avoiding lots of
     redundant format conversions.
   » Relax the requirement to need braces around blend factors when using the
     CoglBlendString syntax. Braces are only needed for factors involving a
     subtraction like "(1 - SRC_COLOR[A])"
   » Adds API for querying the format of a CoglFramebuffer

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.2

   » Optimize pipeline unparent operation using embedded lists instead
     of using GList API.
   » Remove the old matrix operation code we had before pulling in the
     mesa based code, and flatten all our matrix utilities back into one
     maintainable file.
   » Expose cogl_framebuffer_get_red/green/blue/alpha bits to query
     the precision for a framebuffer's color channels.
   » Numerous reference manual updates
   » Fix some memory leaks in CoglPipeline that weren't captured in
     bugzilla.
   » Fix some EGL winsys issues that weren't captured in bugzilla.
   » Switch to dynamically loading libGL, libGLESv2 or libGLES[v1]_CM
     at runtime so it's possible to distribute a libcogl that can choose
     to work with any of these at runtime. This can simplify packaging
     on distros that have numerous packages that provide a platform
     specific GL/GLES driver and certainly helps during the development
     process when evaluating the pros-and-cons of different drivers for
     a given platform.
   » Clean up lots of inconsistencies with platform specific APIs, so
     we follow the naming convention of cogl_<platform>_object_method.
   » Remove cogl_set_default_context from experimental 2.0 api, since
     we are aiming to remove the default context for 2.0
   » Ensure the experimental 2.0 reference manual gets a unique
     DOC_MODULE name so that distro's trying to package cogl don't end
     up installing the 1.x and 2.0 manuals to the same location
   » Add a program cache for the GLSL backend, a bit like we have for
     the ARBfp backend. This can be a big boost in performance for some
     apps depending on your platform.
   » Adds dither_enable getter and setter API for CoglFramebuffer so
     that Clutter doesn't need to use the GL API directly when picking.
     We need to get to the point where Clutter doesn't need to link
     against libGL directly so Clutter can take advantage of runtime
     driver selection by Cogl.
   » Use MESA_pack_invert extension in cogl_read_pixels to avoid
     needing to manually flip pixel data read in bottom-up order to a
     top-down order.
   » Fix the hello example to actually clear the framebuffer at the
     start of the frame instead of unintentionally relying on the driver
     to have cleared the framebuffer.

  • List of changes since Cogl 1.7.0

   » Add an example program to draw a 3D crate

   » Add experimental API to get and set the viewport on a framebuffer
     without going through the implicit context.

   » Add API to select the winsys backend without having to use an
     environment variable.

   » Various documentation fixes.

   » Add winsys-specific typesafe APIs to replace the old
     cogl_renderer_handle_native_event functions.

   » Rename platform-specific APIs so that we consistently have
     cogl_<platform>_symbol_name instead of cogl_symbol_name_<platform>.

   » Fixed building against GLES.
