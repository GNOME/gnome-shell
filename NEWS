Clutter 1.1.14 (24/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.12

    » Fix interaction between user resizable Stages and fullscreen on X11

    » Define the semantics of ENTER and LEAVE events when actors are on the
      border of the Stage window

    » Take the InputDevice of an event into consideration when throttling
      MOTION events

    » Round the coordinates when clipping to a rectangle in window coordinates

    » Always trust the user-provided coordinates when creating a CoglTexture
      from a foreign GL texture

    » Split Clutter's debug annotations from the pick and paint mode
      behavioural modifiers

    » Improve the usage of the CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT flag so that every
      actor using a ClutterFixedLayout manager will automatically benefit
      from it

    » Fix the packing order of ClutterBox so that the convention of
      first-in-first-painted is maintained

    » Documentation fixes

Clutter 1.1.12 (16/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.10

    » Fix compilation on 64bit platforms

    » Fix some races of the Stage resizing on X11

    » Documentation fixes for Cogl: the coverage is now 100%

    » Fix rounding errors in the preferred height of the ClutterText
      actor

    » Remove redundant type checks in clutter_actor_get_paint_opacity()

    » Add support for the GLX_INTEL_swap_event extension; when using this
      extension on GLX the glXSwapBuffers() call becomes non-blocking and
      Clutter will use an event to control the master clock.

    » Improve consistency between ClutterBox and ClutterGroup.

    » On X11, do not set the _NET_WM_PID and WM_TITLE properties on a
      Stage X window if the window was not created by Clutter itself

    » Improve caching of GL constant values

    » Optimize creating sub-textures of sub-textures

    » Various fixes for the atlas and the journal

    » Disable the atlas if FBOs are not supported

Clutter 1.1.10 (09/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.8

    » Fixed a regression in textures that caused all the textures to be
      drawn as white rectangles.

    » Fixed compilation with the Sun C compiler.

    » Use SSE2 instructions to premultiply RGBA images, if available.

    » Improve readability of ClutterActor::raise/::lower warnings.

Clutter 1.1.8 (08/02/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.6

    » Added ClutterAnimator, a class that allows defining complex
      implicit animations involving multiple actors and states; this
      class is mostly meant to be used through the ClutterScript
      definition format, but it provides a convenience C API for
      easily building animations.

    » New experimental COGL API to expose "hardware" buffers such as PBOs or
      drm surfaces. This API can be used, for instance, to make texture
      uploading faster.

    » Fixed the issues with resizable stages getting a 1x1 window with
      the X11 backends

    » Expose input devices for every event; by default, X11 and Windows
      backends expose the core devices only.

    » Add the ClutterStage:key-focus property, for key focus tracking.

    » Allow setting transformable value types in ClutterAnimation when
      calling clutter_animation_bind() and clutter_animation_update().

    » Delay the creation of the default Stage until clutter_stage_get_default()
      is actually called; this reduces the work of clutter_init().

    » Implement Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Backspace in ClutterText

    » Improve the extendability of CoglTexture with internal backends.

    » Add implicit texture atlasing; Cogl will try to put every texture
      inside the same texture atlas by default, to avoid state changes
      in the driver and (hopefully) improve performance.

    » Fix notification of the cursor and selection changes in ClutterText;
      this improves the usage of Clutter from A11Y toolkits.

    » Do not wait for a frame if the system clock goes backwards.

    » Fix the dirtying of the clip state; this unbreaks cogl_path_fill().

    » Documentation and build fixes.

Clutter 1.1.6 (18/01/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.4

    » Some fixes for the Win32 backend (bug #1905).

    » Profiling support via the UProf library. Configure with
      --enable-profile to get a report after each Clutter application is
      run.

    » Improved conformance tests with coverage reports via gcov.

    » ClutterTexture no longer tries to read back texture data into
      g_malloc'd memory on unrealize (bug #1842).

    » The CGL_• defines from cogl-defines.h have been removed. These
      should not have been used by any applications, but if they were
      being used then please replace them either with the Cogl enums or
      with the appropriate GL_• enum if you are using GL directly.

    » Added a delete-event signal to the stage.

    » Fix for using cogl_rectangle with different texture coordinates
      for multiple layers (bug #1937).

    » Fix for using stencil and depth buffers in FBOs on Intel drivers
      in Mesa (bug #1873).

    » Support for subtitles in ClutterMedia.

    » ClutterGLX will now use an RGB visual by default. For
      applications (and toolkit integration libraries) that want to
      enable the ClutterStage:use-alpha property there is a new
      function: clutter_x11_set_use_argb_visual().

    » Fix ClutterText to allow using Pango markup and attributes in
      the same actor (bug #1940).

Clutter 1.1.4 (03/01/2010)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.1.2

    » Update the ClutterScript parser to be more resilient, and support
      constructor and ChildMeta properties. The parser also respects the
      order of the properties in the UI definitions when applying them,
      and will apply the properties of an Actor after building the scene
      graph.

    » Simplified the implementation of LayoutManager sub-classes, and added
      support for animating a layout manager.

    » Allow short-circuiting some layout operations by setting a specific
      flag on ClutterActor.

    » Improve caching of the preferred size of a ClutterActor.

    » Allow declaring "internal children" for a ClutterContainer
      implementation: the memory management of these actors will be deferred
      entirely to the Container.

    » Let the ClutterStage honour the :opacity property and the alpha component
      of the stage color. This requires support in the Clutter backend used.

    » Improve Windows and OSX backends.

    » Simplify the feature detection code for OpenGL; this also reduced the
      required OpenGL version to 1.2.

    » Improve the matrix stack handling code. The matrices can be debugged by
      using the COGL_DEBUG environment variable, assuming that Clutter was
      compiled with the right configure-time switch.

    » Improve COGL API for draw buffers, and for offscreen buffer support.

    » Add support for text direction to ClutterActor.

    » Documentation, introspection and build fixes.

Clutter 1.1.2 (23/10/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since Clutter 1.0

    » Add ClutterLayoutManager, an abstract proxy class for easily
      writing layout management policies; also add ClutterLayoutMeta,
      a class for storing layout properties.

    » Add ClutterBox, a generic container actor that relies on a
      ClutterLayoutManager instance to manage the layout of its
      children.

    » Add the following layout managers:

      - ClutterFixedLayout - a layout manager implementing the
        policy used by ClutterGroup

      - ClutterBinLayout - a layout manager for packing actors
        as layers inside the same area, with per-actor alignment

      - ClutterFlowLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as
        a reflowing grid

      - ClutterBoxLayout - a layout manager arranging actors as
        a single line

    » Remove the requirement for the backend-specific implementation
      of ClutterStage to be a ClutterActor: a Stage implementation must
      only implement the ClutterStageWindow interface. This cleans up
      the backend code.

    » COGL source tree clean up and rationalization; COGL now
      knows the platform, and not only the driver (GL or GLES) so
      we can migrate part of the low-level backend code from Clutter
      to COGL where it makes sense.

    » Remove code duplication across whole COGL.

    » The GLES 2.0 driver for COGL, and the EGLX backend for Clutter
      have been fixed and confirmed working.

    » Add "dump-pick-buffer" to CLUTTER_DEBUG: this debug options
      dumps the contents of each pick() buffer into a PNG file, for
      debugging purposes.

    » Allow interpolating intervals of ClutterUnits for animating
      unit-based properties.

    » Increase strictness and correctness of the ClutterUnits
      grammar parser.

    » Add GValue transformation functions for ClutterPath to and
      from a string.

    » Fix word movement in ClutterText; implement GObject getter for
      :use-markup; emit notification for :position; decouple the
      :text property from the :use-markup property.

    » Do not queue redraws or relayouts on actors currently being
      destroyed. 

    » Support #rrggbb and #rgb notations for ClutterColor.

    » Multiple bug fixes.

    » Provide _NET_WM_PID on the X11 stage implementation.

    » Documentation and Introspection annotation fixes.

    » Add test units for the ClutterActor size requesition.

    » Build fixes.

    » Use AM_SILENT_RULES if Automake 1.11 is detected, and fall
      back to Shave on older Automake versions.

Clutter 1.0.0 (28/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.8

    » Allow per-stage disabling of motion event throttling; this should allow
      platforms or applications that require all the motion events not for
      drawing purposes to get them exactly like Clutter gets them from the
      windowing system.

    » Various documentation fixes.

    » Add per-word key navigation inside ClutterText.

    » Fix the RGB<->HLS conversion.

    » Various fixes for the OSX backend.

    » Various build-related fixes.

Clutter 0.9.8 (17/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.6

    » Add more introspection annotations for language bindings.

    » Fix a bug in clutter_animation_set_alpha(), which also broke the
      clutter_actor_animate_with_alpha() function.

    » Check if the stage requires a relayout before showing it; this fixes
      a bug in the X11-based backends, especially under compositing window
      managers, where a 640x480 window would flicker before the default
      stage was shown for the first time.

    » Performance fixes for Cogl.

    » Sliced textures were broken by the COGL journalling.

    » Use the redraw cycle when asynchronously loading textures from
      files.

    » Miscellaneous compilation fixes for the OS X and Windows backends.

    » Allow querying from within the paint function of an Actor whether
      the actor is currently being directly painted or by a Clone actor.

    » In the GLX backend, when using the non-implicit sync-to-vblank inside
      glXSwapBuffers(), call glFinish() to avoid potential tearing.

Clutter 0.9.6 (01/07/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.4:

    » Allow the manipulation of the actor's transformation matrix, so that is
      is possible to apply additional transformations in a way that is
      compatible with the transformations already applied by the scene graph.

    » Fix a race in the X11 backend that happened between resizing the stage
      drawable and the call to glViewport().

    » Merge the cogl-journal-batching branch; this branch implements batching
      the geometry of the elements of the scene graph before sending it to
      OpenGL, thus minimizing the number of state changes and improving the
      overall performance of Clutter-based applications.

    » Add more debugging states for Clutter and COGL, which allow the developer
      to track the state of the journal; to check the VBO fallback paths; to
      disable picking for reliable profiling; to disable software-side matrix
      transformations in favour of the driver/GPU ones.

    » Improve the ability to "break out" of COGL by using gl_begin/gl_end
      semantics; applications that drop into raw GL are, though, ignoring all
      the caching performed by COGL and might incur in performance issues.

    » Fixed the :load-async and :load-data-async properties of Texture by
      removing the unneeded G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT flag.

    » Added an initial migration guide that shows the porting process from
      older releases of Clutter to the 1.0 API; the first chapter deals with
      the migration from ClutterEffect to the new implicit animations API.

    » Fixed MT-safety for the master clock.

Many thanks to:

Clutter 0.9.4 (19/06/2009)
===============================================================================

  • List of changes since 0.9.2:

    » Set the layout height in ClutterText, so that wrapping and ellipsization
      work correctly to fill all the allocated area.

    » Remove all the units-based API, and migrate all the positional and
      dimensional accessors to use floating point values when dealing with
      pixels. All the properties dealing with pixels now that a floating
      point value as well.

    » Add the ability to track wether an actor is going to be painted or not,
      using the "mapped" flag. This also allows Clutter to be more strict
      in the handling of the scenegraph, ensuring correctness and avoiding
      wasting resources on nodes that won't be painted.

    » Add debugging facilities for COGL, similar to those of Clutter; through
      them is also possible to have an on screen debugging mode that shows the
      boundaries of each rectangle sent to the GPU.

    » Rework "units" into real logical distance units that can be converted
      between millimeters, typographic points and ems into pixels.

    » Simplify the Animation class to avoid redundancy and the possibility
      of it going out of sync with the Timeline and Alpha instances it uses.

    » Move every operation into a single "master clock" source that advances
      the timelines, dispatches events and redraws the stages in a predictable
      sequence, thus avoiding unneeded redraws. The default is to follow the
      sync-to-vblank cycle, if it is supported by the drivers.

    » Cache the glyphs geometry into a vertex buffer object to avoid
      resubmitting too much information to the GPU.

    » Rework the behaviour of ClutterModel when a filter is applied.

    » Allow submitting premultiplied texture data; this removes the need
      for unpremultiplying data in CairoTexture.

    » Add a simple API for submitting blending and texture combining modes
      through a string description.

    » Move Timelines to pure time-based objects.

    » Lots of performance improvements.

    » Removal of all the deprecated API.

    » Removal of all the fixed point entry points.

    » Lots of documentation fixes - the coverage is now 99% of the exported
      1600 symbols for Clutter and 80%+ of the 300 exported symbols for COGL.

    » Generate the GObject Introspection data for both Clutter and COGL
      at build time.

    » Build environment fixes.

Clutter 0.9.0 (30/01/2009)
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.8.6 and 0.9.0

   » ClutterText is a new actor allowing text display, text editing
     both in multi-line and single-line modes, and text selection using
     the pointer devices and the keyboard. ClutterText supercedes both
     ClutterLabel and ClutterEntry.
   » ClutterClone is a new actor that allows cloning of other actors,
     both simple and composite. ClutterClone supercedes ClutterCloneTexture.
   » ClutterBindingPool is a new API that allows to easily add key bindings
     to an actor.
   » ClutterAnimation is a new API for implicit animations, similar to
     the tweening API used in toolkits like jQuery, Tween and Flash. This
     new API supercedes the ClutterEffect API.
   » ClutterAlpha uses "animation modes" instead of raw function
     pointers; it is still possible to pass alpha functions. The alpha
     functions provided by Clutter have been removed from the public
     API. It is possible to register global alpha functions and use
     them though a logical id.
   » The interval of the ClutterAlpha:alpha property has been changed
     to a floating point value in the [ -1.0, 2.0 ] range; this allowed
     the addition of "overshooting" easing modes.
   » COGL now supports backface culling.
   » The COGL-based Pango renderer is public API and it is accessible
     to developers. It is also possible to access the PangoContext used
     by Clutter in order to create PangoLayouts to render text.
   » The ClutterFixed API has been moved to COGL.
   » COGL does not depend on Clutter data types anymore.
   » The ClutterMedia interface has been overhauled: implementations
     now must only override the interface properties. The ranges of
     some properties have been changed to normalized values.
   » COGL now exposes only floating point entry points, and reserves
     the eventual conversion to fixed point only when needed. The
     fixed point type and macros are publicly available for developers
     concerned about floating point operations.
   » COGL has a new Vertex Attribues API that allows submitting an
     extensible number of vertex attributes to OpenGL in a way that
     does not require format conversions and allows fast re-use.
   » COGL has a new Material API that decouples paths from fills; it
     is possible to create an arbitrary path and fill it with a COGL
     texture. The Material API also allows setting multiple texture
     layers and defining the blend modes and colors.
   » ClutterTexture has the ability to use a worker thread to asynchronously
     load an image from a file, as long as the GLib threading support has
     been enabled prior to calling clutter_init().
   » Clutter now supports localization of the help output, and it
     also supports globally setting the text direction for non left to
     right locales.
   » ClutterCairoTexture is a new actor that allows using Cairo
     to draw on a ClutterTexture; since Cairo does not have an OpenGL
     backend, the drawing is not hardware accelerated.
   » Clutter has a unit testing suite, based on the GLib unit test
     framework, which can be used to track regressions.
   » A ClutterPath object has been added, and it is used by the
     BehaviourPath. The Path object allows defining paths using a set
     of coordinates and operations. A Path can be "painted" either using
     COGL primitives or using Cairo primitives, allowing an easier way
     to paint non-rectangular shaped actors.
   » ClutterInterval is a simple object, used by ClutterAnimation, that
     describes an interval between two values, and interpolates between
     the initial and final values of the interval.

   » Removed the ClutterBackend::get_display_size() and wrappers.

   » Verify that the vertex shaders are successfully compiled when binding
     them.

   » Increase safety of the ClutterGLXTexturePixmap

 • List of bugs fixed since 0.7.4

   » #993 - Underline colors are sometimes wrong

Clutter 0.7.4 (25/06/2008), "Killer Koi"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.7.2 and 0.7.4

   » Fix the ClutterEntry actor after the clip API changes in COGL.

   » Update the shaders generated for GLES 2.0.

   » Add the ability to add search paths and look up files from
     ClutterScript. This allows defining directories to store the
     images to be loaded by a ClutterTexture.

   » Warn if no usable pointer device are available on X11 backends.

   » Improve the request for the best pixel format on win32.

   » Fix a regression when sizing the ClutterStage on backends that
     only support fixed size stages; now setting any size will result
     in Clutter ignoring the request, like it happened in Clutter 0.6.

   » Add a method to ClutterBackend to retrieve the display size.

   » Fix clutter_sinx() for angles > CFX_2PI - CFX_ONE.

 • List of bugs fixed

Clutter 0.7.2 (23/06/2008), "Kedoke"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.7.0 and 0.7.2

   » ClutterTexture has a new :keep-aspect-ratio property; when it is set
     to TRUE the texture will return a preferred width maintaining the
     aspect ratio with the given height and a preferred height maintaining
     the aspect ratio with the given width. This allows to set the width or
     the height and have the texture automatically request the height or the
     width respectively while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original
     image.

   » Added XINPUT support on the X11 backends; this provides an initial
     support for multiple input devices. The API is X11-specific, and
     provides support for querying at run-time support for XINPUT, for
     getting a list of input devices and for getting the type of each
     input device. 
 
   » The 'fruity' backend also features multiple device support.

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #816 - clutter_actor_request_coords() should take a const box.

Clutter 0.7.0 (13/06/2008), "Booska"
===============================================================================

 • List of changes between 0.6 and 0.7.0

   » COGL, the underlying GL abstraction layer in Clutter, has been
     completely rewritten from the ground up. Its no longer a conceptual
     hack but a documented, fully featured library pretty much in its
     own right. COGL abstracts over Open GL, Open GL ES 1.1 and now
     OpenGL ES 2.0, providing a smart uniform API over these libraries
     with various utility features such as texture tiling abstractions,
     paths and primitive rendering, FBO, shaders, etc.

   » Clutter now provides an experimental backend for the Apple(tm)
     iPhone and iPod Touch families of products.

   » The Windows platform is now natively supported instead of
     relying on the SDL libraries. The win32 backend is still
     experimental.

   » The X11 based backends now feature support for Actors that wrap
     external X drawables (i.e the texture-from-pixmap extension and
     fallbacks)

   » Clutter now seamlessly supports multiple stages on the backends
     that allow this feature.

   » The custom Pango renderer has been completely rewritten, now using
     the more modern and maintained PangoCairo (instead of FT2), and avoids
     nasty subclassing hacks, supports smooth fast scaling of text, has
     many edge case issues fixed and it still is very efficient (using
     a texture glyph cache). It is even a little bit faster.

   » Better texture support, timeline improvements, ClutterLabel and
     ClutterEntry improvements, and container child properties are among
     the new features - too many to fit in the NEWS file.

Clutter 0.6.0 (18/02/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.6 and 0.6.0

   » New documentation sections inside the API reference, describing
     the animation framework.

   » New API in ClutterActor for computing the actor's vertices in
     the plane of a given ancestor and accessors to query whether an
     actor is scaled or rotated

 • List of bug fixed

   » #613 - Extend point transformation API
   » #779 - Rounding error in ClutterBehaviourScale [Havoc Pennington]
   » #787 - tiled textures are broken
   » #796 - segmentation fault when setting label text

Clutter 0.5.6 (11/02/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.4 and 0.5.6

   » Reverted a last minute change in the depth sorting function of
     ClutterGroup.

   » Added the clutter_actor_move_anchor_point() family of functions,
     which will set the anchor point at the given coordinates while
     adjusting the actor postion so that the relative position of the
     actor toward its parent remains the same.

   » Provide a fallback for finding the Clutter alpha functions inside
     a UI definition for ClutterScript in case g_module_open() fails.

   » Add initial Frame Buffer Objects support in ClutterTexture; using
     FBOs, where supported by the hardware and drivers, it's possible to
     create a ClutterTexture from any actor.

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #386 - Stage is white unless a timeline is present

Clutter 0.5.4 (25/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.2 and 0.5.4

   » A clutter-x11-<major>.<minor> pkg-config file is installed along
     with the clutter-<major>.<minor> and clutter-<backend>-<major>.<minor>
     ones, for libraries and applications depending on the X11-based
     backends (GLX and EGLX).

   » Textures are correctly unrealized before changing and freeing the
     main GL context.

   » It is now possible to block the automatic call to clutter_main_quit()
     when closing the stage window using the frame controls by connecting
     an handler for the ::event signal on the Clutter stage and checking
     for the CLUTTER_DELETE event type and returning TRUE. This allows
     the usage of other main loops with GLib reactors (like Python's twisted)
     with Clutter without triggering assertions by closing the stage window.

Clutter 0.5.2 (14/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.2

   » ClutterModelDefault has been renamed to ClutterListModel

   » ClutterModel now has vector-based variants for append, prepend and
     insert methods; these methods are useful for bindings

   » Add units-based variant for clutter_actor_move_by()

 • List of bugs fixed

   » #694 - Handle GLhandleARB on OS X [Tommi Komulainen]
   » #700 - Fix for clutter_effect_rotate() [Neil Roberts]

Clutter 0.5.0 (02/01/2008)
==========================

 • List of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0

   » New event handling system: every actor with the CLUTTER_ACTOR_REACTIVE
     flag set will receive events from the underlying backend; the event
     propagation chain will be walked in two directions (from the actor to
     the top-level container and back) with the ability to block it in
     both phases.

   » ClutterShader, an abstraction over the programmable OpenGL pipeline.

   » ClutterScore, an object for controlling timelines; using a score
     instance is possible to start multiple timelines at once, or start
     a timeline after another has emitted the ::complete signal.

   » ClutterScript, an object for parsing a scene from an external file or
     a buffer; the scene is described using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
     every object is defined using its class and properties, and container
     objects can have their children defined as well. It is also possible
     do describe top-level objects such as timelines and behaviours, and to
     automatically connect signal handlers to signal names.

   » ClutterTimelines duration can now be set in milliseconds using the
     :duration property; the default framerate will be used to compute the
     actual duration in frames. The default framerate will be set by the
     backend, and can be overridden by the application.

   » ClutterTimelines direction can now be set using the :direction
     property; a timeline can be set to proceed forward or backward,
     and the direction can also be change while the timeline is still
     running.

   » New, experimental OSX backend.

   » Build environment for MS VisualStudio 2005.

   » ClutterModel, a generic list-based model object that can be used to
     implement actors following the Model-Viewer-Controller design pattern.
     Clutter provides a default implementation of ClutterModel, called
     ClutterModelDefault and using the GSequence data structure from GLib
     to optimize insertion and look up.

   » Add the ability to grab pointer and keyboard events: if an actor
     is set to have a grab it'll be the only one receiving events until
     it releases the grab.

   » Add the ability for an actor to receive the key focus; an actor
     with key focus will always receive the key events, even if it did
     not acquire the keyboard grab.

   » It is now possible to set the GL "fog" (also known as "depth cueing")
     effect on the ClutterStage; if the fog is enabled, actors farther
     away from the view point will fade into the stage background color.

   » Each actor now has an "anchor point", a point defined in the actor's
     coordinate space that will be used as the origin when scaling and
     rotation transformations.

   » Every pixel-based API has been doubled with a corresponding
     ClutterUnits-based function (postfixed with a '-u'), for instance:

       clutter_actor_set_position() - clutter_actor_set_positionu()
       clutter_actor_set_size()     - clutter_actor_set_sizeu()
       clutter_actor_set_depth()    - clutter_actor_set_depthu()

     This allows sub-pixel precision and device independence.

   » The ClutterLabel actor now tries very hard to provide a sane
     default size, if no bounding box has been requested; this fixes
     the :alignment property and allows the addition of the :justify
     property.

   » The SDL backend can now be compiled under win32 with MingW; this
     backend is still marked as experimental.

   » The OSX backend allows the compilation of Clutter under OS X; this
     backend is experimental.

 • List of changes between 0.3.1 and 0.4.0

   » Many documentation additions and improvements.

   » Display DPI now honours on backends its can be queried.

   » Various big endian related fixes.

   » ClutterBehaviourEllipse and ClutterBehaviourRotate API and
   internals improvements.

   » Add basic tslib support to eglnative backend (for touchscreen events)

   » clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos should now work on 16bpp displays.

   » New ClutterEffect rotation calls.

   » Allowing user resizing of the stage now optional.
    (implemented by glx backend only currently)

   » ClutterEntry UTF8 fixes and improved automatic initial sizing.

   » Make ClutterActor GInitiallyUnowned.

   » New ClutterBox API: each box has now a colour and a margin (distance
     between the inner-border and the children); plus, each packed child
     has a padding. Margins and paddings are expressed in ClutterUnits,
     to ease the transition to the device independent units. You can use
     clutter_box_set_default_padding() if you want the same padding for
     each child.

Clutter 0.3.1 (06/07/2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1
   » EGL. There are now 2 experimental EGL backends;
     - 'eglx', the former EGL on X11 implementation (now renamed)
     - 'eglnative', a new EGL 'native' backend which supporting non
       X11 EGL implementations (i.e framebuffer).

   » ClutterGroup now returns correct size when a child is removed.

Clutter 0.3 (29/06/2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.2.3 and 0.3
   » Clutter now supports both switchable windowing system and GL backends.
     Window systems supported include GLX, EGL and SDL.

     GL support includes OpenGL 1.2+ and OpenGL ES 1.1. This is
     provided by a small basic abstraction layer 'cogl.h'. Cogl is not
     yet documented - usage external to Clutter is not yet advised.

     Backends may provide specific command line options.

     Notes;

     GLX
     ---
     The GLX backend is built by default and is currently the most
     developed, supported and featured windowing system backend. Only
     OpenGL is supported via GLX.

     SDL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using SDL. Open GL is supported as
     is OpenGL ES via Dogles (very experimental).

     EGL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using EGL. Only Open GL ES
     is supported by EGL.

     EGL support assumes an EGL implementation running atop X Windows.

     Open GL ES.
     -----------

     Clutter now has experimental support for Open GL ES.
     Current known issues;

     + Unrealising a ClutterTexture will not move pixel data from video
       into system memory but simply destroy it.
     + BGRA, YUV Texture data not currently supported.

     (Use the clutter_feature API to probe for above at runtime)

     Open Source ES implementations this has been tested against
     include `Vincent' and `dgles'.  Support for commerical
     implementations may require modifications to the configure.ac
     script.

              (Also see: http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/ogles/ )

     dgles: http://developer.hybrid.fi/dgles/index.html

   » New ClutterEffect class provides a simplified (and thus less flexible)
     API wrapping around behaviours, alphas and timelines.
   » New Behaviours - bspline, ellipsis, rotation.
   » New built in Alpha functions;
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_HALF
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SQUARE

   » New Actors and interfaces
     + ClutterLayout, for writing extended layout support in actors
     + ClutterContainer, for generic container actors
     + ClutterBox, ClutterVBox and ClutterHBox layout actors.
     + ClutterEntry, text entry actor
   » ClutterTexture now handles BGRA, YUV and premultiplied alpha data.
   » All internal math now fixed point based.
   » Clutter now has it own internal event queue.
   » ClutterStage new features;
     + Title property for naming in window decorations.

   » New Clutter_actor •project API calls allow for querying of tranformed
     actor vertices and points.
   » New Clutter Feature checks.

   » Fixes to tile based textures and again clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   » Implement Gravity for ClutterScaleBehaviour. [Matthew, Rob]

Clutter 0.2.2 (2007-03-22)
==========================

 • List of changed between 0.2.1 and 0.2.2
   » Addition of basic XEMBED support for clutter stage. [Matthew]
   » Fixes to clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   » Export clutter_group_remove_all and add associated fixes. [Matthew]

Clutter 0.2.1 (2007-02-07)
==========================

 • List of changed between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
   » Add even faster double to integer (and back) conversion
     functions. [Tomas]
   » Fix some errors in the fixed point sine waveform
     function. [Tomas]
   » Use fixed point math in the Pango renderer. [Tomas]
   » Improve the GL version check. [Matthew]
   » Add a square waveform function. [Emmanuele]
 • List of bugs fixed
   » #215 - macro CLUTTER_MARK() not disabled for non-debug builds

Clutter 0.2 (18-01-2007)
========================

 • List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   » Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   » Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   » Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   » Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   » Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   » Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   » Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage.
   » Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   » Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   » Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   » Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.

Clutter 0.1 (22/06/2006)
========================

 • First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 • Contains:
   » Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   » Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   » Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable.
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   » Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   » An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   » Fairly complete Python bindings.
   » Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 • If you want to help out see the TODO file.
