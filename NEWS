2.8.4

This release features a number of bug fixes, and also the disabling of
the focus-stealing-prevention code (we're entering hard code freeze in
Gnome so it's too late to fix the remaining issues, especially since
it requires several patches to modules other than Metacity).

Thanks to Havoc Pennington, Soeren Sandmann, Elijah Newren, and Rich

Fixes
  * track the last_xor_rect, for wireframe painting (Havoc)

  * Make dialogs that Metacity shows follow focus-stealing-prevention
    conventions. (Elijah; part of #149028)
  * add render extension check to the display, don't build the
    compositing manager by default, use an ARGB visual when available
    for the window frame (Rich Wareham; various tweaks added later by
    Havoc)
  * move the have_xrender variable initialization up in the file since
    it can be set as part of composite check (Havoc)
  * make argb stuff compile, add some code from xcompmgr (Havoc)
  * fix an assertion failure that would occur after increasing the
    number of workspaces; fix stacking order when a window is denied
    focus (Elijah; #150615)
  * disable some compositor code that wasn't working, don't grab the
    server during repaint, various set_background fixes and
    refactoring (Havoc)

   mode" if you open a new window while showing desktop, rather
