# GNOME Shell
GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME 3 desktop,
like switching to windows and launching applications. GNOME Shell takes
advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware and introduces
innovative user interface concepts to provide a visually attractive and
easy to use experience.

For more information about GNOME Shell, including instructions on how
to build GNOME Shell from source and how to get involved with the project,
see the [project wiki][project-wiki].

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME [bug tracking system][bug-tracker].
