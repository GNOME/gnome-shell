# GNOME Shell

GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME desktop,
like switching to windows and launching applications. GNOME Shell takes
advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware and introduces
innovative user interface concepts to provide a visually attractive and
easy to use experience.

All interactions with the project should follow the [Code of Conduct][conduct].

[conduct]: https://conduct.gnome.org/

## Supported versions

Upstream gnome-shell only supports the most recent stable release series,
the previous stable release series, and the current development release
series. Any older stable release series are no longer supported, although
they may still receive backported security updates in long-term support
distributions. Such support is up to the distributions, though.

Please refer to the [schedule] to see when a new version will be released.

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported to the [issue tracking system][bug-tracker].

The [GNOME handbook][bug-handbook] has useful information for creating
effective issue reports.

If you are using extensions, please confirm that an issue still happens
without extensions. To properly disable extensions you can use the
[extensions-app] and then restart your session. Disabling extensions
without a restart is not sufficient to rule out extensions as the
cause of a bug. If an issue can only be reproduced with a certain
extension, please file an issue report against that extension first.

Please note that the issue tracker is meant to be used for
actionable issues only.

For support questions, feedback on changes or general discussions,
you can use:

 - the [#gnome-shell matrix room][matrix-room]
 - the `Desktop` category or `shell` tag on [GNOME Discourse][discourse]

## Feature requests

gnome-shell is a core compoment of the GNOME desktop experience.
As such, any changes in behavior or appearance only happen in
accordance with the [GNOME design team][design-team].

For major changes, it is best to start a discussion on [discourse]
and reach out on the [#gnome-design matrix room][design-room],
and only involve the issue tracker once agreement has been reached.

In particular mockups must be approved by the design team to be
considered for implementation.

For enhancements that are limited in scope and well-defined,
it is acceptable to directly open a feature request.

When in doubt, it is better to ask before opening an issue.

## Contributing

To contribute, open merge requests at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell.

It can be useful to first look at the [GNOME handbook][mr-handbook].

If a change likely requires discussion beyond code review, it is probably better to
open an issue first, or follow the process for [feature requests](#feature-requests).
Otherwise, creating a separate issue is not required.

The following guidelines will help your change to be successfully merged:

 * Keep the change as small as possible. If you can split it into multiple
   merge requests, please do so.
 * Use multiple commits. This makes it easier to review and helps to diagnose
   bugs in the future.
 * Use clear commit messages following the [conventions][commit-messages].
 * Pay attention to the CI results. Merge requests cannot be merged until the
   CI passes.

There's also a [small guide for newcomers][newcomers-contribution-guide] with
a few more basic tips and tricks.
